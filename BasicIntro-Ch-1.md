SQl - Structured Query Language (Language to interact with the Database)

Database - A place where we store/organize our Data (Example: Google Drive).

To deal with these kind of Data, we use somthing called as "Database". It is itself divided into smaller parts called "Tables".

Types of Databases(based on kind of data stored):
* Relational Database: Where we store Data in the form of Tables - SQL helps us to work with Relational Databases.
* Non-Relational Database:  Data is not stored in the form of Tables. We can store in other forms like Document format, key-value pair, Json etc. - MongoDB, Cassandra, NoSQl helps us work
  with Non-Relational Database.

#### Applications: CRUD operations- Create, Read, Update, Delete

### There are 5 types of SQL Commands:

* Data Definition Language (DDL) – to define and modify the structure of a database.
* Data Manipulation Language (DML) – to access, manipulate, and modify data in a database.
* Data Control Language (DCL) – to control user access to the data in the database and give or revoke privileges to a specific user or a group of users.
* Transaction Control Language (TCL) – to control transactions in a database.
* Data Query Language (DQL) – to perform queries on the data in a database to retrieve the necessary information from it.
  
Consider the following Database diagram/schema. (Schema tells us how different things are connected to each other)

"id" would help us to uniquely identify the Order ("orders" table). Hence, "id" can be considered the primary key.
