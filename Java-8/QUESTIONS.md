## ðŸš€ Roadmap: Java 8 Lambdas, Streams, and Method References

### âœ… Step 1: Java 8 Lambda Expressions

* **Concepts to Learn:**

  * What is a Lambda Expression?
  * Syntax and rules.
  * Functional interfaces (`Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, `Predicate`, etc.)
  * Lambda with and without return types.
  * Lambdas capturing local variables (effectively final concept).

* **Practice with:**

  * Sorting collections
  * Iterating lists
  * Filtering data
  * Replacing anonymous classes

---

### âœ… Step 2: Functional Interfaces (before Streams)

* **Important Interfaces:**

  * `Predicate<T>` - for conditions
  * `Function<T,R>` - for mapping
  * `Consumer<T>` - for processing
  * `Supplier<T>` - for providing values
  * `BiFunction`, `BiPredicate`, etc.

* **Practice:**

  * Writing your own functional interfaces.
  * Passing lambda to methods.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Java 8 Stream API

* **Concepts to Learn:**

  * What is Stream? Difference between Collection and Stream.
  * **Intermediate Operations:**

    * `map`, `filter`, `sorted`, `distinct`, `flatMap`
  * **Terminal Operations:**

    * `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`, `count`, `min`, `max`, `anyMatch`
  * Stream creation:

    * From `List`, `Set`, `Map`
    * Using `Stream.of()`, `Arrays.stream()`
  * Lazy vs Eager evaluation.
  * Streams are single-use.
* **Practice:**

  * Convert `List<Integer>` â†’ even numbers list.
  * Convert `List<String>` â†’ uppercase names.
  * Find duplicates.
  * Group data using `Collectors.groupingBy`.
  * Sum/average/count using `Collectors`.

---

### âœ… Step 4: Method References

* **Concepts to Learn:**

  * Types:

    * Reference to a static method (`ClassName::staticMethod`)
    * Reference to an instance method (`instance::instanceMethod`)
    * Reference to a constructor (`ClassName::new`)
  * Difference between Lambda and Method Reference.

* **Practice:**

  * Replace lambdas with method references.
  * Sort using `String::compareToIgnoreCase`.
  * Use constructor references in stream `.map()`.

---

### âœ… Step 5: Advanced Stream API

* **Concepts to Learn:**

  * `Optional` with Streams.
  * `flatMap()` vs `map()`
  * Parallel Streams.
  * Collectors: `groupingBy`, `partitioningBy`, `joining`
  * Custom collectors.

* **Practice:**

  * Find 2nd highest salary.
  * Group employees by department.
  * Partition students by pass/fail.
  * Join names with comma-separated string.
