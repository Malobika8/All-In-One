#  In microservices, should each service have its own database? Why or why not? What are the **benefits** and what are the **challenges** of this approach?

### Sol:

Yes, in microservices architecture, **each service should have its own database**.
This principle is called **"Database per service"** and is a key part of **loose coupling and autonomy**.

#### Why each service should have its own DB:

1. **Data Ownership**
   Each microservice owns and manages its own data. This ensures the team working on the service is **fully responsible** for how data is persisted and retrieved.

2. **Loose Coupling**
   If services share a database, schema changes in one service can **break** others. Having separate DBs avoids this tight dependency.

3. **Independent Deployment**
   Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently **without impacting others**.

4. **Polyglot Persistence**
   Different services can choose **different database technologies** (e.g., MySQL for one, MongoDB or Cassandra for another) depending on their needs.

#### Challenges of this approach:

1. **Data Consistency**
   Itâ€™s hard to enforce **ACID transactions** across services since each has its own DB. We have to use **eventual consistency** patterns.

2. **Complex Reporting**
   Running reports that need data from multiple services (e.g., Order + Payment) becomes harder â€” requires data aggregation or data lakes.

3. **Operational Overhead**
   More databases mean more to **manage, monitor, and secure** â€” this increases infrastructure complexity.

4. **Data Duplication**
   Some data may need to be **replicated or cached** between services, increasing redundancy.

#### How to manage cross-service consistency?

* Use **asynchronous communication** with **events** (e.g., using Kafka).
* Use patterns like:
  * **Saga Pattern** for distributed transactions
  * **Outbox Pattern** for reliable messaging

> "Each service having its own DB is critical for true independence and loose coupling, but it does make consistency and reporting harder â€” which we solve using async messaging and distributed transaction patterns like Saga."

#### Example: Youâ€™re using the **same DB vendor** (e.g., MySQL), but each microservice has its **own logical database**, like:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
CREATE DATABASE order_db;
CREATE DATABASE payment_db;
```

Each service connects **only to its own DB**, for example:

* `StudentService` â†’ `student_db`
* `OrderService` â†’ `order_db`
* `PaymentService` â†’ `payment_db`

#### âœ… Why This is Accepted (and Ideal for Many Teams):

1. âœ… **Logical isolation**: Each service has its own schema, migrations, and lifecycle.
2. âœ… **No foreign keys** across services â€” they are **fully decoupled**.
3. âœ… **Less operational overhead**: You can use the same MySQL server or cluster â€” easier to manage than 3 different vendors.
4. âœ… **Still polyglot-ready**: You can switch one of the services to MongoDB or Postgres later if needed.

#### ðŸš« What You Should Avoid:

* Using a single database like `main_app_db` and putting all service tables in it.
* Creating **foreign key constraints between services** (`order.user_id â†’ user.id`).
* Sharing connection pools or credentials between services.

> "We use MySQL for all services but maintain separate logical databases â€” like `student_db`, `order_db`, etc. â€” so each service owns and manages its own data, ensuring clean separation and avoiding cross-service dependencies."
