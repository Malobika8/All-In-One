### Consider the following,

```
@Component
public class PersonDao {

    @Autowired
    EntityManagerFactory entityManagerFactory;

    @Transactional
    public void save(Person person){
        EntityManager entityManager = entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager();
        entityManager.persist(person);
    }
}
```

### Why is this approach incorrect?

It has a significant issue with how the `EntityManager` is used in conjunction with transactions. 

---

### **Issues in the Current Code**

1. **`EntityManager` Lifecycle**:  
   - You are manually creating an `EntityManager` using `entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()`. However, this approach does not integrate properly with the Spring transaction management provided by `@Transactional`.
   - When you use `@Transactional`, Spring binds an `EntityManager` to the current transaction context automatically. Manually creating an `EntityManager` bypasses this mechanism, and the `@Transactional` annotation might not work as expected.

2. **Transaction Management**:  
   - The manually created `EntityManager` is not automatically synchronized with the ongoing transaction, leading to potential issues (e.g., operations not being committed or exceptions due to no active transaction).

3. **Missing `EntityManager` Close**:  
   - When you manually create an `EntityManager`, you are responsible for closing it. In your code, the `EntityManager` is never closed, potentially causing resource leaks.

---

### **Correct Implementation**

Instead of manually creating an `EntityManager`, you should rely on Spring to inject a properly managed `EntityManager` into your DAO. Here's the revised code:

```java
@Component
public class PersonDao {

    @PersistenceContext // Injects a Spring-managed EntityManager
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Transactional
    public void save(Person person) {
        entityManager.persist(person); // Uses the managed EntityManager
    }
}
```

---

### **Explanation of Changes**

1. **`@PersistenceContext` Annotation**:  
   - Spring injects a transaction-bound `EntityManager` into the `entityManager` field. You no longer need to create or close it manually.

2. **Automatic Transaction Management**:  
   - With `@Transactional`, the `EntityManager` operates within the scope of the transaction. It handles committing, rolling back, and closing resources as needed.

3. **Simplified Code**:  
   - By delegating the responsibility of `EntityManager` creation and management to Spring, you reduce boilerplate code and ensure best practices are followed.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. **Exception Handling**:
   - You can rely on Spring's exception translation mechanism. For this, annotate your DAO class with `@Repository` instead of `@Component`. This ensures JPA exceptions are translated into Spring's `DataAccessException`.
   ```java
   @Repository
   public class PersonDao {
       @PersistenceContext
       private EntityManager entityManager;

       @Transactional
       public void save(Person person) {
           entityManager.persist(person);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Custom Queries**:
   - If you need to run custom queries, you can use JPQL or Criteria API:
     ```java
     @Transactional
     public List<Person> findAll() {
         return entityManager.createQuery("SELECT p FROM Person p", Person.class).getResultList();
     }
     ```

---

### **Best Practices**
- Always rely on Spring to manage `EntityManager` and transactions for consistent behavior.
- Annotate DAO classes with `@Repository` to benefit from exception translation.
- Avoid manually managing the lifecycle of `EntityManager` unless absolutely necessary.

---

## What if we want to use @Autowired?

There are key points to address when you want to use `@Autowired` to inject an `EntityManager` directly instead of using `@PersistenceContext`. The main issue lies in how you are creating and managing the `EntityManager` in your current setup.

---

### **Problems with Your Configuration**
1. **EntityManager Lifecycle Management**:
   - The `EntityManager` created by `entityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()` is not managed by Spring or tied to transactions started by `@Transactional`. This may cause issues like:
     - Operations performed outside of a transaction.
     - Failure to flush changes to the database.
     - Resource leaks, as the `EntityManager` needs manual closing.

2. **Bean Definition for `EntityManager`**:
   - Defining an `EntityManager` as a Spring-managed singleton bean (`@Bean`) is not the correct approach. Each transaction should get its own `EntityManager` instance, which is managed by Spring automatically.
