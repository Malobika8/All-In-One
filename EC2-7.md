Exce**AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** â€” the most fundamental AWS service for deploying applications like your Spring Boot apps.

## ðŸ§  Step 0: What is EC2?

> **Amazon EC2** is a service that lets you launch **virtual machines (VMs)** (called instances) in the cloud.
> You can install Java, databases, or your Spring Boot app on them â€” just like you would on a Linux server.

ðŸŸ¢ Think of EC2 as **your own Linux/Windows computer running in the cloud**, billed by the hour or minute.

## âœ… Step 1: Key EC2 Concepts You Should Know

| Term               | Meaning                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AMI**            | Amazon Machine Image (like a Linux or Windows template)               |
| **Instance Type**  | Hardware config (e.g., 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU)                              |
| **Key Pair**       | A `.pem` file used to SSH (log in) securely                           |
| **Security Group** | Like a firewall: defines open ports (e.g., 22 for SSH, 8080 for apps) |
| **Elastic IP**     | A public IP address you can assign to your instance                   |
| **Root Volume**    | The disk attached to the instance (like C: or /)                      |

## âœ… Step 2: Is EC2 Free?

Yes â€” **t2.micro** and **t3.micro** instances are free-tier eligible:

| Spec            | Value               |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| CPU             | 1 vCPU              |
| RAM             | 1 GB                |
| OS              | Linux or Windows    |
| Free Tier Limit | **750 hours/month** |

ðŸŸ¢ You get 750 hours total per month (not per instance).

## âœ… Step 3: What Weâ€™ll Do in This EC2 Practice

Weâ€™ll launch a virtual Linux machine (Ubuntu), and:

1. SSH into it from your terminal
2. Install Java
3. Upload your Spring Boot JAR
4. Run it and access it via browser
