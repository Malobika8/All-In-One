# Web Services (A service that's made available with the web)

A web service is a set of open protocols and standards that allow data to be exchanged between different applications or systems. It is a software system that provides a specific 
functionality or service to other applications over the web. It enables communication between different systems, allowing them to exchange data and functionality. Web services are 
typically implemented as a RESTful API, which uses HTTP requests and responses to interact with clients. They can be built using various programming languages and frameworks, and can 
be deployed on multiple platforms. Examples of web services include payment gateways, social media APIs, and weather services, which provide data and functionality to other applications
and users.  

### Isn't everything online is a WebService then? (Ecom, Chatting apps etc)

The difference between a standard Website and a WebService is that a Website is meant for Human consumption while a WebService is meant for Code consumption or Application-level consumption.
A WebService allows 2 different machines / 2 different pieces of code / 2 different applications running on 2 different servers to be able to talk to each other.

## Types
