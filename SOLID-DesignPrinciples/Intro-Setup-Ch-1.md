# SOLID Design Principles

SOLID is an acronym for first five Object Oriented Design principles by *Robert C. Martin.*

It's a set of guidelines for building clean, maintainable, and scalable software architecture. SOLID stands for five design principles:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each component should have only one reason to change.
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

SOLID is an acronym for five principles that help you design software that's:
- Maintainable
- Scalable
- Readable
- Testable
- Flexible
