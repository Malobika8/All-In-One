## Association

```
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), association is a type of relationship between two or more classes. It allows for the connection of objects from
different classes without implying a specific relationship. This is achieved through a reference variable from one class that refers to an
object of another class. Association is contrasted with inheritance, where a child class inherits properties from a parent class. In contrast,
association is a flexible way to connect objects without creating an "is-a" relationship, enabling more complex relationships between objects.

## Dependency

```
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a dependency refers to a relationship between two classes where one class relies on the other for its proper functioning. This is usually achieved through a coupling mechanism, such as method calls, data inheritance, or instance composition. Dependencies can be either strong (tightly coupled) or weak (loosely coupled). Strong dependencies make it difficult to change one class without affecting others, while weak dependencies facilitate more flexibility and modularity. Understanding dependencies is crucial for designing maintainable and scalable software systems in OOP.
```

Dependency will be of form parameter/method return type.
