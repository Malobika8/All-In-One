## üê≥ What Is Docker Compose?

**Docker Compose** is a tool that allows you to **define and run multi-container Docker applications** using a simple YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`).

---

## üí° Why Do We Need It?

When you:

* Have **multiple services** (like microservices)
* Need to **run them together** (like app + database)
* Want to define **how each container runs**, its **environment**, **volumes**, etc.

üëâ Doing that manually with `docker run` gets messy.

### ‚úÖ Docker Compose solves this by:

* Letting you define all services in **one file**
* Managing **networking, volumes, and dependencies**
* Letting you run everything with just:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## üóÇÔ∏è docker-compose.yml ‚Äî The Blueprint

It‚Äôs a YAML file placed in the **root of your project** that describes:

### Key Concepts:

| Field                | What it Does                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `services:`          | The containers you want to run (like app, db, frontend, etc.)              |
| `build:` or `image:` | Tells Docker to either build from a `Dockerfile` or pull an existing image |
| `ports:`             | Maps container ports to your machine‚Äôs ports                               |
| `volumes:`           | Mounts files or folders                                                    |
| `depends_on:`        | Tells Compose which containers should start first                          |
| `environment:`       | Set environment variables like DB credentials                              |

## üß± Minimal Compose Example

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb
```

This says:

* Build and run a `web` service from the current folder
* Run a `mysql` container
* Automatically network them together
* Expose ports

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands You Should Know

| Command                     | Description                |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `docker-compose up`         | Start all services         |
| `docker-compose up --build` | Rebuild images and start   |
| `docker-compose down`       | Stop and remove containers |
| `docker-compose ps`         | List running services      |
| `docker-compose logs`       | View logs from services    |

---

## üß† How Networking Works in Compose

All services defined in `docker-compose.yml` are put on a **shared network** automatically.

So one service can talk to another **by name**!

‚úÖ Example:

* Your Java app can connect to MySQL using hostname `db` instead of `localhost`

```java
jdbc:mysql://db:3306/mydb
```

## üß™ Summary: Why You Should Use Docker Compose

‚úÖ When your app grows beyond a single container
‚úÖ When you need databases, caching, messaging, or other services
‚úÖ When you want simple repeatable commands to start your whole system
