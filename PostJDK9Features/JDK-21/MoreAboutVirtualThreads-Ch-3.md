## 1. How Tomcat works with **Thread-per-Request** model

* Tomcat (and most Java servers) traditionally follow **thread-per-request**:

  1. A client request comes in (say HTTP request).
  2. Tomcat assigns a **dedicated thread** from its thread pool to handle that request.
  3. The thread processes the request ‚Üí runs servlets, filters, DB calls, etc.
  4. When the request completes, the thread returns to the pool.

* **Bottleneck**:

  * Threads are **heavyweight objects** at the OS level (backed by native resources like stack memory, kernel scheduling).
  * Each thread typically consumes **1 MB of memory** for stack by default.
  * If Tomcat has 200 threads ‚Üí that‚Äôs \~200 MB stack usage just waiting.
  * When requests are waiting on I/O (DB, network, file), the thread is **blocked** but still occupies memory and counts towards limits.
  * Scaling beyond a few thousand threads becomes **very costly**.

## 2. Platform Threads (Traditional Java Threads)

* In Java, `Thread` is a **Platform Thread** (before JDK 19).
* Backed **1:1** with an OS thread ‚Üí meaning each Java thread = one native OS thread.
* Expensive to create and manage:

  * **Creation cost** (kernel call, memory allocation).
  * **Context switching** between threads at OS level.
* Good for concurrency but not for **massive scale** (like 100k connections).

## 3. Virtual Threads (Project Loom, JDK 19+)

### Introduction

* **Virtual Thread** = lightweight thread managed by JVM, not OS.
* They are implemented **in user space**, on top of a small pool of carrier **platform threads**.
* **1M virtual threads** is possible on same machine where only \~2k platform threads were feasible.

### Difference from Platform Threads

| Aspect        | Platform Thread            | Virtual Thread                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Backed by     | OS thread (1:1)            | JVM, multiplexed onto few platform threads |
| Creation cost | High (kernel call, \~1 MB) | Very low (\~KB stack, user mode)           |
| Blocking I/O  | Wastes OS thread           | JVM suspends & unmounts ‚Üí no OS block      |
| Scalability   | Thousands                  | Millions                                   |

## 4. How Virtual Threads Work Internally

* **Mounting / Unmounting**:

  * A virtual thread runs code on a **carrier platform thread** (like renting a worker).
  * If the virtual thread hits a **blocking I/O** call:

    * JVM **parks/unmounts** it from the carrier thread.
    * Carrier thread is freed to run another virtual thread.
    * When I/O completes, the virtual thread is **mounted back** on any available carrier and resumes.

* This avoids wasting a native thread while waiting on I/O.

* **Carrying Thread (Carrier Thread)**:

  * A small set of real platform threads (like workers).
  * They ‚Äúcarry‚Äù virtual threads when they need CPU.
  * Acts as bridge between **JVM virtual threads** and **OS threads**.

## 5. Why Virtual Threads are Fast

* **Lightweight creation** (no kernel involvement).
* **No blocking waste**: waiting threads are unmounted.
* **Scheduler in JVM** (instead of kernel) ‚Üí faster, less overhead.
* Ideal for servers that need to handle **massive concurrent connections**.

---

## 6. Why Virtual Threads are Best for I/O-bound, not CPU-bound

* **I/O-bound tasks**:

  * E.g., DB query, HTTP call, file read.
  * Virtual thread gets unmounted when waiting ‚Üí high concurrency, low waste.
  * Can handle millions of open connections cheaply.
* **CPU-bound tasks**:

  * E.g., heavy computation (sorting, ML training).
  * Virtual thread can‚Äôt unmount, keeps consuming a carrier thread.
  * Too many CPU-bound virtual threads = starvation, because CPUs are limited.
  * Use **parallel streams / thread pools** for CPU-heavy tasks instead.

# ‚úÖ Final Summary

* **Tomcat thread-per-request** = 1 thread per client request ‚Üí bottleneck = limited by OS thread memory & blocking.
* **Platform threads** = Java `Thread`, 1:1 with OS thread, costly to scale.
* **Virtual threads** = lightweight, managed by JVM, mounted/unmounted on carrier threads.
* **Internals**: Virtual threads ‚Äúborrow‚Äù a carrier thread, unmount when blocking, remount when ready.
* **Fast because**: cheap to create, no wasted blocking, managed in JVM.
* **Best for**: I/O-bound tasks (massive concurrency).
* **Not best for**: CPU-bound tasks (limited by number of cores).
