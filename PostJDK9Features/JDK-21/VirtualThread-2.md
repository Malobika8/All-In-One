# ✅ Java 21 Final Feature: **Virtual Threads**

> Also known as **Project Loom** — and finalized in **JDK 21**

## 🔹 What are Virtual Threads?

Virtual threads are **lightweight, high-scale threads** managed by the **JVM**, not the OS.

> You create them just like normal threads — but they **consume much less memory** and **scale much better**.

## 🔍 Traditional vs Virtual Threads

| Feature              | Platform Thread (Old)   | Virtual Thread (New)           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Backed by            | OS thread (heavyweight) | JVM-managed task (lightweight) |
| Memory per thread    | \~1MB                   | \~few KB                       |
| Max scalable threads | Thousands               | **Millions** 🔥                |
| Blocking behavior    | Ties up OS thread       | Freely parked/resumed by JVM   |
| Use case             | Limited concurrency     | Massive concurrent tasks       |

## ✅ How to Create Virtual Threads (Java 21)

### 🔸 Run a virtual thread:

```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Running in a virtual thread!");
});
```

That's it — it's that simple.

---

## ✅ Example: Launch Thousands of Virtual Threads

```java
public class VirtualThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // ✅ Safe! Doesn’t block OS thread
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        };

        for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            Thread.startVirtualThread(task);
        }

        Thread.sleep(2000);
    }
}
```

✅ This can create **10,000+ threads** without memory issues.
Doing the same with platform threads would crash or freeze most systems.

---

## ✅ Behind the Scenes

* `Thread.sleep()` and I/O operations in virtual threads are **non-blocking**
* JVM **"parks"** virtual threads when waiting, and **resumes** them later — no OS threads are held up

## ✅ When to Use Virtual Threads

| Use Case                    | Benefit                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Web servers / REST services | Handle 1000s of concurrent users  |
| Batch jobs / schedulers     | Run huge number of parallel tasks |
| Blocking APIs (JDBC, etc.)  | Don’t block real threads anymore  |
| Microservices + Spring Boot | Virtual thread support is growing |

## ⚠️ Gotchas

| Caveat                                   | Explanation                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Not for CPU-bound tasks                  | Use thread pools for CPU work               |
| Blocking native calls (like `File.read`) | May still block real threads                |
| Monitor locks (`synchronized`)           | Can degrade performance if overused         |
| Java EE/Servlets                         | Needs framework support (Spring 6.1+, etc.) |

## ✅ Summary

| Feature            | Virtual Threads                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Scalable Threads   | ✅ Millions possible                |
| Lightweight Memory | ✅ Few KB per thread                |
| Works like Threads | ✅ Same API                         |
| I/O Friendly       | ✅ JVM parks/resumes blocking calls |
| Huge Productivity  | ✅ Simplifies concurrency           |
