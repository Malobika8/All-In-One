# Factors of a number

A number that divides another number is called a factor of that number.

Factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20

Run a loop from 0 to 20 & find which all numbers divide that. (Time complexity - O(n))

Even in this, if we observe, we would notice repetition.

We can check till square root of n.

But if n=36, 6 will be printed twice as "* 6*6 = 36*". We can modify the code to eliminate duplication.

### Co-primes:
*Coprimes are a fundamental concept in number theory. Two integers, a and b, are coprime or relatively prime if their greatest 
common divisor (GCD) is 1. In other words, the only common factor between a and b is 1.*
