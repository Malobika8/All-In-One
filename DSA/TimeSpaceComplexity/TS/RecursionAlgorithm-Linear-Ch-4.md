# Solve homogeneous linear Recurrence Relation (don't have any separate function like g(x))

We can find formulas for these relations which can give us answers in a single step.

Let's take the example of Fibonacci Number.

### Steps:
- Step 1:

- Step 2: If we have Œ±1 & Œ±2 as two roots, we can write it as,

- Fact: No of roots that we have is equal to the number of answers that we have.

  ### We got the formula for the nth Fibonacci number. We can use this directly. No need to run recursion or even iteration. üòÅ

  This would have taken a lot of time if we had done recursively. It wouldn't even work for 50.

## How to solve

Steps:

- Replace g(n) with 0 & solve usually.

- Put g(n) on one side and find a particular n.

- Add both solutions together.

## How do we guess a particular solution?

- If g(n) is exponential, guess of the same type.

- If it is polynomial, guess of the same degree.

- If it fails, try for the next degree.
