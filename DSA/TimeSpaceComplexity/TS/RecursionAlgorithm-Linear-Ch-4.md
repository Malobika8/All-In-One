# Solve homogeneous linear Recurrence Relation (don't have any separate function like g(x))

We can find formulas for these relations which can give us answers in a single step.

Let's take the example of Fibonacci Number.

### Steps:
- Step 1:

- Step 2: If we have Œ±1 & Œ±2 as two roots, we can write it as,

- Fact: No of roots that we have is equal to the number of answers that we have.

  ### We got the formula for the nth Fibonacci number. We can use this directly. No need to run recursion or even iteration. üòÅ

  This would have taken a lot of time if we had done recursively. It wouldn't even work for 50.
