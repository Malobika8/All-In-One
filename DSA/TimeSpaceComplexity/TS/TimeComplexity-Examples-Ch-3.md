## Recursive Algorithms

In this case, time needs to considered for every single function call.

Space Complexity: Recursive programs do not have constant Space Complexity. This is because the function calls are stored in Stack and 
hence takes memory.

Note: Only calls that are interlinked with each other will be called at the same time.

```
The longest chain from root to leaf of the Recursion tree determines Space complexity.
Space Complexity = HeightPath of the Tree = total number of elements present in the program = O(n)
```

#### Types of Recursion problems:
- Linear: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
- Divide & Conquer: f(n) = f(n/2) + O(1)

### How we can get the Time Complexity i.e. Big O notation formulas of these equations?

### Divide & Conquer Recurrence Relations
