We can keep on printing till column is less than row. If t is greater, we can reset column to 0 and increment row by 1 (so that it goes to the
next row).

If we print while returning back, we will get normal triangle.

## Q3. Bubble Sort

The first question is nothing but bubble sort. Only differnce is to check two consecutive numbers in each pass and swap instead of printing *.
With each pass, we will get the correct result at the end of the array which won't be considered in the next pass.

So, for five elements, number of passes will be 

4(1 element will be sorted and placed at the end) -> 3(2 sorted elements in the end) -> 2(3 sorted elements in the end) -> 1(4 sorted elements in the end)
