`@Controller` and `@Component` in Spring both indicate that a class should be managed as a bean in the Spring IoC container. However, the difference lies in their intended use and the specific context in which they are applied. Here's a detailed comparison:

### 1. **Purpose**
   - **`@Component`:**  
     A generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component. It indicates that the class is a Spring-managed bean, but it doesn't provide any specific role or semantics.
     - Example: Utility classes, helper classes, and any general-purpose beans.

   - **`@Controller`:**  
     A specialization of `@Component` specifically designed for presentation-layer classes in the MVC architecture. It signals that the class is responsible for handling web requests and returning responses (or views).
     - Example: Controllers in a web application.

### 2. **Semantics**
   - **`@Component`:**  
     Doesn't imply any specific function or behavior apart from being a managed bean.
   - **`@Controller`:**  
     Clearly expresses the intent that the class will handle HTTP requests, often working in conjunction with `@RequestMapping` and other related annotations.

---

### 3. **Functional Behavior**
   - **`@Component`:**  
     No additional features or configurations are added beyond being a Spring bean.

   - **`@Controller`:**  
     When used in a Spring Web MVC application:
     - Classes annotated with `@Controller` are automatically registered with the DispatcherServlet.
     - They are capable of mapping web requests to handler methods using annotations like `@RequestMapping`.
     - They may return a `ModelAndView` or JSON/XML responses when used with `@ResponseBody`.

---

### 4. **Spring Context Integration**
   - Both annotations register beans in the IoC container, but:
     - **`@Controller`**: Typically works in the **WebApplicationContext**, where web-related beans are managed.
     - **`@Component`**: Can be used anywhere in the application, often for non-web-specific functionality.

---

### 5. **Readable Code**
   - Using `@Controller` makes the intent of the class more explicit to developers, which enhances code readability and maintainability.

---

### Summary
- Use **`@Component`** for generic Spring-managed beans.  
- Use **`@Controller`** for classes in the MVC architecture that handle HTTP requests and define endpoints.  

Even though `@Controller` is a specialization of `@Component`, it carries additional semantics and functionalities tailored for web application controllers.
