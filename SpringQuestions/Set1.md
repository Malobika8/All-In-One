### 1. What do you mean by Spring IOC?

Earlier, we were responsible for creating the object for classes. With Spring framework, Spring takes the resposibility for creating and managing the objects. As the name suggests, IOC 
(i.e. inversion of control) means the control lies with Spring rather than users.

### 2. What do you mean by Spring beans?

The objects created by Spring in the IOC container are referred to as Spring beans.
