If we use `@Service` in place of `@Controller` in a controller class, the application will still work, but it may not behave as expected in a typical Spring MVC setup. Here's a detailed explanation of what happens:

---

### 1. **Bean Registration**
- **What happens?**
  - The class will still be registered as a Spring bean in the IoC container because `@Service` is a specialization of `@Component`.
- **What's the issue?**
  - The class won't be recognized as a Spring MVC controller. As a result, the DispatcherServlet won't process it to handle HTTP requests.

---

### 2. **Request Mapping**
- **What happens?**
  - The `@RequestMapping` (or similar annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`) defined in the class will not be processed by the DispatcherServlet.
  - HTTP requests matching the mapping will result in a **404 Not Found** error because the class is not registered as a controller.

---

### 3. **Semantics**
- **What happens?**
  - `@Service` indicates a business/service layer component, which is not intended to handle web requests. Using it in place of `@Controller` confuses the purpose of the class.
  - This can lead to confusion for other developers maintaining the codebase, as the intent of the class is unclear.

---

### 4. **Alternative Scenarios**
If you want to make the application work despite using `@Service`:
1. You would need to explicitly configure the bean to act as a handler by manually registering it in Spring MVC's request-handling context.
2. This is unnecessarily complex and defeats the purpose of using `@Controller`.

---

### 5. **Best Practices**
While the application won't fail to start, **using `@Controller` is the correct approach** for controller classes. This ensures:
- Proper registration with the DispatcherServlet.
- Clear communication of the class's role as a request handler.
- Alignment with Spring MVC conventions.

If you mistakenly use `@Service` in a controller class, change it to `@Controller` to avoid unnecessary confusion and potential issues with request handling.
