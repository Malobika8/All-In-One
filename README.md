## Error we frequently come across:

```
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for ...
```

means that Git is unable to authenticate you with the remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). Here's how to fix it depending on how you're authenticating.

---

## ✅ Step-by-step Fix:

### 🔍 Step 1: Identify if You're Using HTTPS or SSH

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You’ll see something like:

```
origin  https://github.com/username/repo.git (fetch)
```

or

```
origin  git@github.com:username/repo.git (fetch)
```

* If it starts with `https://` → You're using **HTTPS**.
* If it starts with `git@` → You're using **SSH**.

---

### 🔐 Step 2: If Using HTTPS (most likely)

#### 🔑 GitHub or GitLab recently **disabled username/password login**. You must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)**.

**Fix:**

1. **Generate a new Personal Access Token (PAT):**

   * **GitHub:** Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) → Generate a new token (classic)
   * **GitLab:** [https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal\_access\_tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens)
   * Give it permissions like `repo`, `read/write`.

2. **Use this PAT instead of your password.**

   * When Git asks for username → enter your GitHub/GitLab **username**
   * When Git asks for password → paste the **PAT** (not your password!)

3. ✅ To cache the credentials:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper cache
   ```

   or permanently:

   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

---

### 🔑 Step 3: If Using SSH

If you're using SSH but still getting this error, you may need to:

1. Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
   ```

2. Add your SSH public key to GitHub/GitLab:

   * Copy it: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   * Add it to your account:

     * GitHub: [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
     * GitLab: [https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys)

---

### 🧹 Optional: Clear Old Cached Credentials

If you previously entered a wrong password:

```bash
git credential-cache exit
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

Or manually clear the saved credentials from your OS’s credential manager (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, etc.)
