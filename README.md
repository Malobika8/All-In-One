# Java 8 important topics

* Lambda Expressions: Concise functional code using ->.
* Functional Interfaces: Single-method interfaces.
* Introduced and Improved APIs:
  - Stream API: Efficient Data Manipulation.
  - Date/Time API: Robust Date and Time Handling.
  - Collection API Improvements: Enhanced Methods for Collections (e.g., removeIf, replaceAll).
  - Concurrency API Improvements: New classes for parallel processing (e.g., CompletableFuture).
* Optional Class: Handle null values safely.
* forEach() Method in Iterable Interface: Executes an action for each element in a Collection.
* Default Methods: Evolve interfaces without breaking compatibility.
* Static Methods: Allows adding methods with default implementations to interfaces.
* Method References: Refer to methods easily.
