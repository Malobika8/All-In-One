# Roadmap

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Core Java (Strong Foundation)

Expected to be fluent in:

* **Java Fundamentals**: OOP, Collections, Generics, Exception handling.
* **Java 8+ Features**: Streams, Lambdas, Optional, Date/Time API.
* **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Executors, Futures, CompletableFuture, synchronization, locks, thread pools.
* **New Java Versions**: Know key features from 9â€“21 (modules, var, records, switch expressions, pattern matching, virtual threads).

ðŸ“Œ At 3 years, you should **solve medium-hard coding problems** using Java Streams, Collections, and multithreading comfortably.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Frameworks & Backend Development

### Spring & Spring Boot (non-negotiable):

* **Spring Core**: IoC, DI, Bean Scopes, Lifecycle.
* **Spring Boot**: Auto-configuration, properties, starters, profiles.
* **Spring MVC**: Controllers, REST endpoints, request mapping.
* **Spring Data JPA**: CRUD repositories, queries, relationships, pagination.
* **Spring Security**: Authentication (basic, JWT, OAuth2), Authorization.
* **Spring Cloud (microservices)**: Config server, Eureka, Feign, Resilience4j, API Gateway basics.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Microservices & Architecture

* Microservices principles: Loose coupling, scalability, API contracts.
* Inter-service communication: REST, gRPC, Kafka.
* **Design Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Observer, Proxy, Circuit Breaker.
* **Saga Pattern / Event-Driven Design** basics.
* **API Best Practices**: URI design, versioning, idempotency, error handling.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Databases

* **SQL**: Joins, subqueries, window functions, indexes, transactions.
* **NoSQL**: MongoDB basics (when and why to use).
* **Performance**: Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Cloud & DevOps Awareness

Companies expect some **cloud knowledge**:

* **AWS** (at least basics): EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda.
* **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI.
* **Docker**: Containerize a Spring Boot app.
* **Kubernetes (K8s)** basics (deployment, scaling, services).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Testing

* **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** for unit testing.
* **Spring Boot Test** for integration testing.
* TDD / BDD familiarity.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Git & Collaboration

* Git commands deeply: branch, merge, rebase, stash, reflog.
* Git workflows: GitFlow, trunk-based.
* Conflict resolution.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. Problem Solving & DSA

* Solve coding challenges (LeetCode/InterviewBit/Codeforces).
* Arrays, Strings, Hashing, Stack/Queue, LinkedList, Trees, Graphs, DP.
* System Design basics (even for 3 years!): URL shortener, chat app, e-commerce cart.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. AI + Developer Productivity

* Use **AI tools smartly** (Copilot/ChatGPT):

  * Generate boilerplate code, configs.
  * Speed up unit tests, SQL queries.
  * Assist in debugging & documentation.
* But also **show that you can code without AI** in interviews.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. Soft Skills & Mindset

* Communicate technical trade-offs.
* Participate in code reviews.
* Write clean, maintainable, testable code.
* Adaptability â†’ Learn quickly (AI, cloud, new frameworks).
* Team collaboration (remote/hybrid setups).

---

âœ… **Summary**:
At 3 years, youâ€™re expected to be a **solid contributor** who can independently develop and deploy features, debug production issues, and write clean tested code.
You donâ€™t need to be a "tech architect," but you must:

* Have **strong Java + Spring Boot fundamentals**.
* Know **microservices + cloud basics**.
* Be good at **DSA for interviews**.
* Be **aware of AI tools** (and not afraid of them).
