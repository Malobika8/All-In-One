# Satellites

Satellites **are** used for internet, but they are less common compared to traditional ground-based infrastructure like fiber-optic cables due to certain limitations. However, they are becoming more important, especially in remote areas. Here's a detailed breakdown of why satellite internet isn't as widely used as terrestrial infrastructure and why it's still relevant:

### 1. **Latency Issues**:
- **Latency** is the time it takes for data to travel between the user and the server, and back. For satellite internet, data must travel to space and back, which increases latency.
  - **Geostationary satellites**, commonly used for satellite internet, are positioned about **35,786 km (22,236 miles)** above the Earth. This distance means that signals take longer to travel, leading to latency of around 600 ms (milliseconds) or more. For comparison, fiber-optic cables have latency as low as 5-30 ms.
  - High latency is problematic for real-time applications like **online gaming**, **video conferencing**, and **VoIP (voice over IP)**, which require fast, back-and-forth communication.
  
### 2. **Lower Speeds**:
- **Satellite internet** typically offers lower data speeds than fiber-optic or even cable internet, though this is improving with newer technologies.
  - Traditional satellite systems offer download speeds ranging from **5 Mbps to 100 Mbps**, while fiber-optic connections can deliver **up to 1 Gbps** or more.
  - **Bandwidth** on satellites is shared among users, so speeds can decrease during peak usage times, similar to how cable internet can slow down during busy periods.

### 3. **Capacity and Cost**:
- **Satellites have limited capacity** for data transmission compared to fiber-optic networks, which can handle enormous volumes of data. This capacity constraint means that satellite internet is often more expensive, especially when you consider the cost of launching and maintaining satellites.
  - Laying fiber-optic cables is expensive upfront, but once installed, they provide high-speed, high-capacity connections at a lower ongoing cost.

### 4. **Weather Sensitivity**:
- Satellite internet is more susceptible to **weather conditions** like heavy rain, snow, or storms. These conditions can disrupt the signal between the satellite dish and the satellite in orbit, leading to temporary slowdowns or outages.
  - **Fiber-optic cables**, on the other hand, are buried underground and largely immune to weather-related issues.

### 5. **Geostationary vs. Low Earth Orbit Satellites**:
There are two types of satellites used for internet:

- **Geostationary Satellites (GEO)**: These are the traditional satellites positioned far from Earth (about 35,786 km). They cover large areas but have high latency and limited capacity. Most traditional satellite internet providers, like HughesNet or Viasat, use these satellites.
  
- **Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites**: LEO satellites, such as those used by **Starlink** (by SpaceX), orbit much closer to Earth (between 500 and 1,200 km). Because they're closer, they have much lower latency (20-40 ms), making the experience comparable to terrestrial internet. However, many satellites are needed to provide global coverage. LEO satellite constellations are promising but are still in the early stages of deployment compared to traditional methods.

### 6. **Cost of Infrastructure**:
- Building and launching satellites is **expensive**. It costs hundreds of millions of dollars to put a satellite into space. In contrast, installing terrestrial fiber-optic cables, though also costly, has a lower long-term cost and much higher capacity. 
- The ongoing maintenance costs of satellite systems are also higher, which can drive up the prices that consumers pay.

### 7. **Global Coverage**:
- While satellites can provide **global coverage**, including remote or rural areas where laying cables is too difficult or expensive, most populated areas are already served by terrestrial networks (fiber, DSL, cable) because these systems offer better speed, lower latency, and lower costs.
- Satellite internet is typically used in **remote regions**, rural areas, or places where terrestrial internet infrastructure is difficult or impossible to install.

### Why We Still Use Satellites for Internet:
Despite these limitations, satellites **are still essential** for several reasons:

1. **Remote Areas**: In rural or isolated areas, especially in places like mountains, deserts, or on ships and planes, terrestrial infrastructure (fiber or even cellular towers) might not be feasible. Satellites can provide reliable internet in such places.

2. **Global Connectivity**: Satellite networks, especially LEO constellations like **Starlink**, are increasingly being developed to provide internet access in underserved or developing regions of the world where fiber-optic infrastructure is too expensive or logistically impossible to build.

3. **Emergency Situations**: In the event of natural disasters or infrastructure failures, satellite internet can provide a backup when terrestrial networks go down.

4. **Military and Scientific Applications**: Satellite internet is often used by the military, scientific expeditions, and organizations working in remote environments (e.g., polar regions) where no other infrastructure exists.

### Conclusion:
While satellites aren’t the first choice for internet in populated areas due to issues like latency, speed, and cost, they are crucial for providing **global coverage**—especially in rural or underserved regions. Emerging technologies like LEO satellites are starting to close the gap with fiber-optic and ground-based infrastructure by offering lower-latency and higher-speed satellite internet services.
