# Communication

When computers communicate over a network, they transmit binary data—sequences of 0s and 1s—by encoding it into signals that travel through various transmission media. The method of encoding and the type of signal depend on the specific medium used. Here's how it works for different transmission types:

1. ### Wired Transmission (e.g., Ethernet Cables)
Electrical Signals: In wired networks, data is transmitted as electrical signals over copper cables. 

The binary data is represented by varying the voltage levels on the wire:
- A high voltage (e.g., 5 volts) might represent a binary '1'.
- A low voltage (e.g., 0 volts) might represent a binary '0'.
  
These voltage changes create electrical pulses that propagate through the cable, carrying the encoded information. The receiving device interprets these voltage levels to reconstruct 
the original binary data (Eland Cables).

2. ### Wireless Transmission (e.g., Wi-Fi)
Radio Waves: In wireless networks, data is transmitted using radio waves. 

The binary data is encoded into these waves by modulating certain properties of the carrier signal, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase:
- Amplitude Modulation (AM): Varying the strength (amplitude) of the signal to represent data.
- Frequency Modulation (FM): Changing the frequency of the signal to encode information.
- Phase Shift Keying (PSK): Altering the phase of the signal to represent data bits.

The modulated radio waves travel through the air and are received by devices within range, which demodulate the signal to retrieve the original binary data (The Conversation).

3. ### Optical Transmission (e.g., Fiber-Optic Cables)
Light Signals: In optical networks, data is transmitted as light pulses through fiber-optic cables. The binary data is represented by the presence or absence of light:

- A light pulse may represent a binary '1'.
- No light pulse may represent a binary '0'.

These light signals are generated by lasers or LEDs and are transmitted through the fiber-optic medium to the receiving device, which converts the light back into electrical signals to 
reconstruct the binary data (BBC).

In all these cases, the fundamental process involves converting binary data into a form that can be transmitted over the chosen medium—whether it's electrical pulses, radio waves, or 
light signals—and then converting it back into binary data at the receiving end. This process is governed by various communication protocols and standards to ensure accurate and 
efficient data transmission.
