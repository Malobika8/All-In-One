# Internet Service Provider

When we talk about **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**, they play a key role in providing internet access, but the structure is a bit more 
layered. 

Here's how it works:

### 1. **Different Levels of ISPs**:
There are various levels of ISPs, and not all of them own the massive infrastructure connecting continents. ISPs can be categorized into tiers based on their role in the internet's structure:

- **Tier 1 ISPs**: These are the big companies that own the physical infrastructure, such as the **submarine cables** that run across oceans and connect different continents. Tier 1 ISPs typically have a vast network of fiber-optic cables and don't need to pay other companies to access the internet because they are the backbone providers. Examples of Tier 1 ISPs include companies like AT&T, Verizon, Level 3, and NTT.

- **Tier 2 ISPs**: These providers have some infrastructure of their own (like fiber optic cables and data centers) but need to connect with Tier 1 ISPs to access the global internet. They often serve large regions, countries, or metropolitan areas and may peer with other networks to keep traffic local. They may own extensive fiber networks within a country but not the international links.

- **Tier 3 ISPs**: These are local ISPs that typically buy bandwidth from Tier 1 or Tier 2 ISPs to provide internet access to end-users, like homes, small businesses, and even local governments. They usually serve specific regions or cities. They rely on other networks for broader internet access but often handle local infrastructure (like the lines running from the street to your house).

### 2. **Submarine Cables and Backbone Infrastructure**:
- The internet relies on a complex network of **undersea cables**, **land-based fiber optic lines**, and **satellite links** to connect continents. These submarine cables, owned by Tier 1 ISPs and large telecommunications companies, handle the majority of international internet traffic.
- Within a country or region, the large fiber-optic cables form the **backbone** of the internet. ISPs connect to this backbone, either directly or indirectly.

### 3. **Regional and Local Distribution**:
Once these backbone cables are in place, ISPs extend connections to cities, towns, and neighborhoods through **local infrastructure**, like:
- **Fiber-optic cables**
- **Coaxial cables**
- **DSL lines**
- **Wireless connections** (for areas where physical cables are less feasible)

### 4. **How ISPs Provide Service**:
- **Backbone Providers (Tier 1 ISPs)** own the main physical cables, especially the ones that connect across continents and large regions.
- **Regional ISPs (Tier 2)** then connect to these backbone providers and distribute internet access through their own networks.
- **Local ISPs (Tier 3)** buy bandwidth from Tier 1 or Tier 2 providers and deliver internet to homes and businesses via local cables (e.g., fiber, copper, or coaxial).

### 5. **Infrastructure Ownership**:
- Owning the massive undersea cables is expensive, so only large telecom companies or consortiums of companies handle that.
- Smaller ISPs lease capacity from the backbone networks and handle the **"last mile"**—the final part of the connection that actually reaches individual users, which could be fiber, copper, or wireless technologies.

### Example:
Let’s say you’re in a country using the internet:
- Your local ISP (Tier 3) provides you access by connecting your home to their network.
- They may get their bandwidth from a regional Tier 2 ISP that operates across your country or region.
- That Tier 2 ISP may, in turn, connect to a global Tier 1 ISP that owns and maintains undersea cables or other backbone infrastructure, linking your country to the rest of the world.

In this way, ISPs work together across multiple layers to deliver internet services from international cables all the way to your home.
