For a router to "hop" from one network to another (or from one router to the next), the data must indeed be converted into signals suitable 
for transmission over the physical medium. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the process:

## Data Transmission Process through Routers

### 1. Data Generation:

An application on a source device generates data that is passed down through the layers of the OSI model.

### 2. Transport Layer (Layer 4):

The transport layer segments the data and adds a transport layer header. The resulting segments are passed to the network layer.

### 3. Network Layer (Layer 3):

The network layer encapsulates the transport layer segments into packets and adds a network layer header with routing information (source and destination IP addresses).
The packet is then passed to the router.

### 4. Router Operations:

When the router receives the packet:
- It examines the destination IP address in the packet header.
- Using its routing table, the router determines the next hop (either to another router or to the final destination).
- The packet is then prepared for forwarding.

### 5. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):

Before sending the packet out to the next hop, the router encapsulates the packet into a frame by adding a data link layer header (including MAC addresses) and a trailer.
This frame is now ready to be sent to the next device (another router or the destination device).

### 6. Physical Layer (Layer 1):

The frame is passed down to the physical layer, where it is converted into signals for transmission over the physical medium (such as copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless signals).
The physical layer converts the binary data of the frame into the appropriate electrical, optical, or radio signals for the specific transmission medium.

### 7. Transmission to the Next Hop:

The signals are transmitted through the physical medium to the next router or device.
When the signals reach the next router, they are received by the physical layer of that router.

### 8. Receiving Router:

The receiving router's physical layer converts the incoming signals back into binary data, creating a new frame.
The data link layer processes this frame, stripping off the data link layer header and trailer to retrieve the packet.
The router then examines the packet's IP address and repeats the routing and forwarding process.

## Summary of Key Points
- Conversion to Signals: The conversion from binary data to signals occurs at the physical layer of the OSI model.
- Hopping from Router to Router: For a router to forward data to the next hop, the data must be encapsulated into a frame and converted into signals suitable for the transmission medium.
- End-to-End Process: The packet moves through the layers, being encapsulated at each step, and is converted into signals at the physical layer for actual transmission. Each router along the path performs this process until the data reaches its final destination.

This entire process allows routers to efficiently forward data packets across networks, ensuring they reach their intended destinations.
