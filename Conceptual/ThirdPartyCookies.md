# Third-party cookies

**Third-party cookies** are cookies that are set by a domain other than the one you are currently visiting. They are primarily used for **tracking** and **advertising** across different websites. Here’s how they differ from first-party cookies and what their purpose is:

### 1. **First-party vs. Third-party Cookies**
- **First-party cookies**: These are cookies created by the website you are currently visiting. They are used for things like keeping you logged in, remembering your preferences, or storing items in your shopping cart.
  - Example: If you visit `example.com`, the cookies set by `example.com` are first-party cookies.
  
- **Third-party cookies**: These are cookies set by a different domain than the one you are visiting. These usually come from external services embedded in the website, such as advertising networks, social media widgets (like Facebook's "Like" button), or analytics services.
  - Example: If you visit `example.com`, but the page loads an ad from `ads-tracker.com`, a cookie from `ads-tracker.com` would be considered a third-party cookie.

### 2. **How Third-party Cookies Work**
When you visit a website that contains embedded content (ads, widgets, etc.) from another domain, that content can set third-party cookies. These cookies are stored on your browser, just like first-party cookies, but they are accessible to the third-party domain (e.g., an ad network) rather than the website you’re directly visiting.

Here’s how it might look in practice:
- You visit a news website, `news.com`.
- The site has advertisements served by an ad network, `ads.com`.
- `ads.com` sets a third-party cookie in your browser to track your visit.
- Later, when you visit another site, `shopping.com`, which also uses the same ad network (`ads.com`), that cookie is used to track your behavior across both sites.
- This allows `ads.com` to build a profile about you, showing you targeted ads based on your browsing history across multiple websites.

### 3. **Purpose of Third-party Cookies**
Third-party cookies are mainly used for:
- **Cross-site tracking**: Tracking a user’s activities across multiple websites. This helps build a profile of the user’s interests, behavior, and preferences.
- **Targeted advertising**: By tracking users across various sites, advertisers can serve more relevant ads based on the user’s past behavior. For example, if you visit a site about fitness, you might later see ads for workout equipment on other websites.
- **Analytics**: Third-party cookies can also be used to gather analytics data for a website, like tracking user interactions, referral sources, and how users navigate through the site.

### 4. **Privacy Concerns**
Third-party cookies have raised significant privacy concerns because they enable extensive tracking of users across the web. This tracking often happens without the user’s explicit consent or knowledge. Some concerns include:
- **Building detailed user profiles**: Ad networks and trackers can gather a large amount of data about a user's habits, preferences, and even personal information.
- **Invasion of privacy**: The data gathered can sometimes feel intrusive, as it allows companies to track you across many sites, including those you may not have expected to share your data.

### 5. **Blocking Third-party Cookies**
Due to these privacy concerns, many browsers now offer options to block third-party cookies or have started to phase them out altogether:
- **Safari** and **Firefox** block third-party cookies by default.
- **Google Chrome** has announced plans to phase out third-party cookies by 2024, introducing alternative methods like the **Privacy Sandbox** to balance privacy with the needs of advertisers.

### 6. **Alternatives to Third-party Cookies**
With the phasing out of third-party cookies, new technologies and methods are being developed to replace them, such as:
- **First-party data**: Websites might rely more heavily on first-party data (information collected directly from the user during their interaction with the site).
- **Browser-based tracking**: Techniques like **Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC)**, where browsers group users into anonymized cohorts based on similar browsing behavior, allowing targeted ads without individual tracking.
- **Contextual advertising**: Serving ads based on the content of the website, rather than tracking users' behavior across multiple websites.

### Summary
Third-party cookies are cookies set by domains other than the website you are currently visiting. They are commonly used for tracking users across different websites for purposes like targeted advertising and analytics. While useful for advertisers, they have raised privacy concerns, leading to efforts to block or phase them out in favor of more privacy-conscious alternatives.
