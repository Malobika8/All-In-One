✅ Here's what you should know 

- Explain what S3 is and its use as object storage

- Create S3 buckets with proper region, naming, and settings

- Upload files to S3 from a Spring Boot API

- Download files from S3 via REST API

- Use best practices like:

  - Avoid MultipartFile.getFile()

  - Stream with InputStream

  - Use PutObjectRequest and GetObjectRequest

- Configure S3 client with access keys via @Configuration bean

- Avoid root AWS account, use IAM safely

- Understand DevTools and build/reload in Spring Boot

- Handle basic S3 errors (e.g., file not found)

- Talk about bucket policy, permissions, and basics of ACL

That’s already enough for a solid “Cloud Aware Java Developer” in interviews.
