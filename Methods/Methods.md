# Methods

In Java, there is no particular thing as *Pass By Reference*. In Java, there is only *PassBy Value*.

In memory, variable is stored in Stack and it references the value which is stored in Heap. Hence, the value is also called as Reference Variable.

When we pass a value to a function, a copy of the value of the reference variable is passed. So the argument in the function references the 
same value in Heap.
