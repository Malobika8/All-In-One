### 💥 What is SQL Injection Risk?

**SQL Injection Risk** refers to a **security vulnerability** that occurs when **untrusted input (usually from a user)** is included directly in a SQL query — allowing an attacker to manipulate the query to execute **arbitrary SQL commands**.

---

### 📌 Simple Definition:

> **SQL Injection** happens when a hacker inserts malicious SQL code into an application's query logic, often via form inputs or query parameters, to access, modify, or destroy database data.

---

### ⚠️ Why Is It Dangerous?

* Bypass **authentication**
* Extract sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit cards)
* Modify or delete data
* Drop entire tables or databases
* Execute administrative operations (e.g., shutdown database)

---

## 🧪 Example of SQL Injection

### ❌ Vulnerable Code (Java):

```java
String username = request.getParameter("username");
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'";
Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
```

### 😈 Input:

```
username = ' OR '1'='1
```

### 🔥 Final Query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'
```

> This returns **all users**, bypassing login checks!

## ✅ How to Prevent SQL Injection

| Technique                                       | How it Helps                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)** | Automatically escapes dangerous input |
| **ORMs (like JPA, Hibernate)**                  | Generate safe queries internally      |
| **Input validation**                            | Reject inputs with SQL metacharacters |
| **Stored procedures** (if used properly)        | Can limit direct query access         |
| **Use least privilege DB accounts**             | Limit damage if injection occurs      |
| **Logging and alerting**                        | Detect unexpected query patterns      |

---

## ✅ Safe Java Example (PreparedStatement)

```java
String username = request.getParameter("username");
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(sql);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
```

✔️ No injection possible — the input is safely handled.

## 🛡️ Real-World Impact

* SQL Injection was ranked in **OWASP Top 10** for many years.
* Famous data breaches (e.g., Sony Pictures, TalkTalk) were caused by SQL Injection.

## 🧠 Summary

| 🔴 What | SQL queries built by string concatenation with user input |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚠️ Risk | Unauthorized data access, data loss, full DB control      |
| ✅ Fix   | Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORMs   |
