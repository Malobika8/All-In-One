# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture: Pros, Cons and Which to Choose

Businesses face a choice of monolithic vs microservices architectures for application development. While monolithic architecture has been the standard choice for a long time, as the digital 
economy moves to a more subscription-based model, it’s starting to look outdated.
Nowadays, many companies are opting for microservices architecture for their application needs instead. Amazon AWS is one example of a company that has already adopted microservices, 
citing flexibility and ease of deployment as key benefits.

What does all this mean for you and your business? 

In this guide, we’ll illuminate the key features, benefits, and limitations of both monolithic and microservices architecture to help 
you choose the best option for your business.

Many companies are instead turning to microservices architecture for their application needs. Amazon AWS, for example, has already adopted this, citing flexibility and ease of deployment
as key benefits.

### What is monolithic architecture?

Monolithic architecture is the name for a specific software program form. The model is constructed in a single block (otherwise known as a “monolith”), with all components tightly 
coupled into a single, cohesive unit. A monolithic computing network will use one code base and runtime environment to create a single-tiered application. This means that multiple 
services, such as API’s, databases, load balancers, and more, will function as one large application organized into different layers. However, all the components, as well as any 
associated components, need to be present for the software to successfully run.

Monolithic architecture is generally considered a good choice for smaller programs that need quick and cheap deployment, however, they lack flexibility and can be difficult to scale. 
We’ll go into more detail regarding monolithic architecture pros and cons later on.

### Monolithic architecture examples
A typical monolithic architecture application has a front-end user interface, a server-side interface, and a codebase (software-supporting database). If your needs are simple and you 
need a quick turnaround, monolithic is the obvious choice.

An example would be if your business was a startup with plenty of great ideas but not a lot of resources. To launch your business, start scaling, and attract the attention of investors, you would need to get your product to market as quickly as possible.

In this case, monolithic architecture is your friend. You can put an app together rapidly, without expending too many resources. The monolithic architecture allows you to get your business up and running in good time, and you can take the time to optimize and improve your programs later on as you scale.

Monolithic architecture is also a good choice if you know your product won’t need a lot of future scaling. In this case, you can keep things simple and cost-effective without sacrificing quality.

### What is microservices architecture?
Microservices architecture is an alternative approach to the development of applications. Also known simply as microservices, this approach creates a larger application out of multiple,
modular services that communicate via APIs. These loosely coupled, independently deployable services use independent databases and coding, as well as a specific business goal.

An individual team is typically responsible for each service used in a Microservices architecture. This allows for updating, testing, deployment, and scaling that is individual to each service and creates manageable complexity.

### Microservices examples
Microservices have a lot of applications, but a common one is the restructuring of legacy systems.

Let’s say you’re a well-established company with an unwieldy legacy system. You want to modernize, move your systems to the cloud, change certain functionalities, or improve your digital
systems in a more general way.

In this case, microservices can help you to optimize and improve incrementally, without too much downtime or resource expenditure at once.

Microservices are also useful if you need to do a significant amount of real-time data streaming and processing, such as the type streaming services, online banking, or eCommerce applications are known for doing. Microservices are far more capable of handling this kind of data load than monolithic applications.

## Microservices vs monolith software
When it comes to microservices vs monolith software, some people might be tempted to assume that whatever is newer is better. However, it’s not quite that simple.

Identifying your business needs and goals is always the key to unlocking your organization’s potential. While microservices allow greater scalability and flexibility, they also require 
more resources for service coordination and deployment management.

Taking a closer look at the differences between monolithic and microservices architectures will help you know which is best for your business.

## Monolithic architecture pros and cons
### Advantages of monolithic architecture
A good monolithic application has a lot of advantages. Here are just a few:

1. Simple development: Monolithic architecture is advantageous if you want to develop an entire application and get it to market quickly.

A small team can rapidly pull together and build an executable app using a monolithic system. This makes monolithic architecture ideal for startups without big software development 
budgets.

2. Easy deployment: Monolithic architecture is not as complex as microservices. It has fewer moving parts, so there are fewer components to manage and fix.

The self-contained nature of a monolithic app makes it easier to deploy, manage, and maintain than a microservices solution.

3. Uncomplicated testing and debugging: Because the application is fitted as a single unit and works together as a whole, you can perform monolithic architecture testing and debugging
   quickly and easily from a central logging system.

### Disadvantages of monolithic architecture
While you shouldn’t ignore all the advantages of monolithic architecture, it is essential to consider the drawbacks as well. If the following disadvantages of monolithic architecture 
would pose an issue for your business, then monolithic programs are not right for you.

1. Less scalability: Because monolithic architecture software is tightly coupled, it can be hard to scale. If you want to add new features or your codebase grows, you will need to
   take the entirety of the architecture with you.

Even if you only want to boost or alter a single function, the entire application needs changing. As well as being time and resource-consuming, this can also cause disruptions to 
continuous delivery.

2. Inability to adapt to new technologies: As mentioned before, monolith applications are tightly coupled. Take a music app, for example. The catalog is connected tightly to the
   purchase and play services.

While useful in some cases, this also means it’s hard to bring in new technologies or web services without dismantling the entire app.

3. High dependence between functionalities: Monolithic applications can also run into software engineering and downtime difficulties because of their tight dependency.

Let’s go back to that music app example. Because the catalog, play, and purchase functions are so dependent upon one another, if one goes down, the others will go down with it.

While some people may only want to listen to tracks they already have in their catalog, meaning they aren’t using the purchasing function, if that function breaks, the whole app would 
be functionally unusable until the payment issue was fixed.

## Microservices pros and cons
### Advantages of microservices architecture
Microservices have a lot going for them. Here are a few reasons why many companies have chosen them to boost their business capabilities:

1. Independent services: In microservices architecture, each service is developed independently of the others, with the business logic spread over various platforms. This means workflows
   for one service don’t affect the development of others. Furthermore, resources such as development tools aren’t dependent on irrelevant functionalities.

Instead, each service gets the full attention of its own team. This enables quick and efficient independent development, followed by simply coupling the services together.

2. Enables agile development: As each service is developed independently, you can choose the tech stack and programming language that best suits each function. This means the best tools
   can be used for each particular service. In contrast, monolithic software architecture sometimes forces services into a one-size-fits-all approach.

This kind of agility allows applications to be developed more quickly and efficiently.

3. Scalable and reliable: We’ve spoken about how monolithic technology can be hard to update and scale. That’s not the case with hybrid cloud microservices. Because of each function’s
   loose coupling, it’s easy to optimize, test, debug, and fix functions independently of one another.

Rather than putting the whole app into downtime and scaling each service, you can instead tweak and upgrade independent services as and when needed.

This loose coupling makes microservice architecture services more reliable. One crashed service doesn’t bring down the entire app. If something goes wrong with an API gateway, the other
services can still operate independently.

So, to return again to the music app example, even if the purchase and download functions crashed, customers would still be able to access the user interface and play music they already 
owned.

With microservices, all application parts need to be tested separately, from the software architecture to things like caching, dependencies, and data access. You also have to test that 
all the services work together properly. This can make microservices testing expensive and time-consuming before the debugging itself has even begun.

### Disadvantages of microservices architecture
However, just like monolithic architecture, you must carefully consider the disadvantages of microservices as well. Here are the most noteworthy:

1. Time and resource-consuming: While the individual autonomy of each microservice can speed up development, it can also slow it down. It all depends on how complex of an app you want
   to make.

This is because while developing an individual microservice is usually quicker and more efficient than developing the same service in a monolithic context, implementing lots of 
different microservices and putting them all together can take a substantial amount of time.

Furthermore, while microservices allow you to use the optimal tools for each service, putting individualized tech stacks together can require a lot of resources and expertise.

2. Complicated deployment: Once you’ve developed each microservice, they need to be integrated into a functional app before they can be deployed. This can be a complicated process.

For a start, cross-cutting (in which each microservice needs validation or authorization to proceed) can be difficult. With monolithic architecture, tight coupling means an 
authorization for one service usually works as authorization across the board. That’s not the case for microservices, and to make it so you need to perform complicated linkage work.

All in all, deploying a microservice architecture isn’t always easy, and it gets harder the more complex your app is.

3. Complex testing: Every service in a microservice application has to be tested individually. Once all the individual service tests have been completed, you need to test how they work as a whole.

It’s important to test before releasing any product to market (and then to run regular functionality tests for as long as the product remains in circulation). If you want these tests 
to be as quick as possible, microservices may not be for you.

Should you update monolithic software to microservices?
As monolithic architecture is the older program model, many businesses started their software development journeys with this architecture, and have stuck with it as it is known for 
being stable and reliable. However, businesses that have grown and evolved may now be constrained by their monolithic services. 

So, is migrating to microservices the right solution? 

These are the factors you should consider before making the jump:

- Business goals: Before choosing a software program architecture, you will need to assess your business goals. While monolithic architecture has its advantages, it can become complex
  and difficult to manage as businesses grow. Microservices provide agility and scalability, as well as the ability to independently develop and deploy services and easily add new
  features.

  If your business is aiming for significant growth, the benefits of microservices, such as faster development cycles, better fault isolation, and improved scalability, will outweigh the costs and complexities of migrating from a monolithic architecture.

- Application complexity: Evaluate the complexity of your current monolithic application. If it is small, well-structured, and adequately meets your current and future requirements, a
  migration to microservices may be unwarranted. There’s no need to upgrade if it doesn’t suit your needs, however, if you want to enjoy some of the benefits of microservices, a hybrid
  migration to microservices could help your business grow without completely abandoning the benefits you’re still gaining from your monolithic architecture.

- Resources: Moving from a monolithic architecture to microservices involves significant changes to software infrastructure, including breaking down an application into independent
  services, defining service boundaries, implementing communication mechanisms, and updating deployment and monitoring processes.

  You will need to ensure you have the necessary technical expertise, as well as the time and budget to successfully carry out your migration strategy.

- Costs: Migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices can be complex and time-consuming. It is also not without risk.

  Migration may involve rewriting or refactoring parts of the codebase, updating infrastructure and deployment processes, and ensuring proper integration and coordination among
  services. Make sure that the long-term benefits of microservices will outweigh the disruptions to your business that the migration process will cause.

## FAQs about monolithic applications
### Is it possible to use a hybrid of monolithic and microservices?
The short answer is yes, a hybrid approach, which combines the benefits of both monolithic and microservices architectures, is possible.

In a hybrid architecture, certain parts of the application are designed and implemented as microservices, but the core functionality remains within a monolithic structure. This allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of both monolithic and microservices architectures.

### Are communications between microservices secure?
The security of communications between microservices depends on the implementation and configuration of the communication mechanisms. While the communications between microservices are not inherently secure, measures can be implemented to protect data and guarantee security.

Some key considerations for ensuring secure communications between microservices include authentication and authorization, encryption, secure communication protocols, network segmentation, firewalls, and continual monitoring and auditing.

When choosing a migration service provider, consider the features that they offer to keep your microservice connections secure.
