  Note: Make sure to initialize the repository before trying this - *git init*

#### To displays a list of all the remote repositories that are currently configured in Git

- Command - *git remote -v*

  When we run this command, we'll see a list of remote names and their corresponding URLs. This can help us manage multiple remote repositories, track changes made by other developers,
  and collaborate with others in a distributed development environment.
