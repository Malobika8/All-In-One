## üîπ Why Do We Need Encoding Systems Like ASCII or Unicode?

Computers store everything as **binary (0s and 1s)** ‚Äî whether it's text, images, or videos.

But humans deal with **characters** like `A`, `B`, `1`, `@`, `‚ô•`, `‰Ω†`, etc.

So, there must be a **standardized way to map characters to numbers (binary)** so computers can understand and store them.

That‚Äôs where **character encodings** like **ASCII** and **Unicode** come in.

---

## üî∏ What is ASCII?

**ASCII** = *American Standard Code for Information Interchange*

* It was created in the 1960s.
* It only supports **English characters**.

### üî§ What it includes:

* Uppercase letters: `A` to `Z`
* Lowercase letters: `a` to `z`
* Digits: `0` to `9`
* Common symbols: `@`, `#`, `$`, `+`, etc.
* Control characters: newline, tab, etc.

### ‚úÖ Example:

| Character | ASCII Decimal | Binary   |
| --------- | ------------- | -------- |
| A         | 65            | 01000001 |
| a         | 97            | 01100001 |
| 0         | 48            | 00110000 |

### üö´ Limitations:

* Only 128 characters (7 bits) ‚Äî can‚Äôt handle characters like `√©`, `√ü`, `‚Ç¨`, `‰Ω†`, `üòä`.

---

## üî∏ What is Unicode?

**Unicode** is a **universal** character encoding system meant to include **all characters** in all languages (and symbols, emojis, etc.).

* Started in the 1990s.
* Can represent **over 1 million characters**.
* It‚Äôs the **modern standard**.

### üì¶ Unicode is not just one thing:

It comes in **different encodings**, such as:

| Encoding | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| UTF-8    | Most common on the web, uses 1 to 4 bytes per character |
| UTF-16   | Uses 2 or 4 bytes per character                         |
| UTF-32   | Uses exactly 4 bytes per character                      |

## üîÅ ASCII vs Unicode

| Feature          | ASCII                           | Unicode                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Year created     | 1960s                           | 1990s                                |
| Size             | 7 bits (128 characters)         | Variable (UTF-8: 1‚Äì4 bytes)          |
| Language support | English only                    | All human languages, emojis, symbols |
| Compatibility    | Included in Unicode (first 128) | Superset of ASCII                    |

‚û°Ô∏è So, **Unicode includes ASCII**. The first 128 characters of Unicode are the same as ASCII.

---

## üîç Why do multiple encodings (like UTF-8, UTF-16) exist?

They are different **ways of storing** Unicode characters in memory or files:

* **UTF-8** is space-efficient for English text (same as ASCII) but can grow for other languages.
* **UTF-16** is better for languages like Chinese, Japanese, but less efficient for plain English.
* **UTF-32** is fixed-size but wastes space.

---

## üîö Final Analogy:

Think of characters like **people from different countries**.

* **ASCII** is like a guest list with only Americans.
* **Unicode** is like a guest list for the **entire world** ‚Äî with **translation** systems (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.) deciding how to fit each person‚Äôs name tag in memory.

---

## ‚úÖ Can we write entire programs in **Hindi** or **other languages**?

### üî∏Answer: **Partially ‚Äî yes**, but with **limitations**.

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **What can be written in any language?**

* **Comments**: ‚úÖ Yes
* **Variable names**: ‚úÖ Yes
* **Function names**: ‚úÖ Yes
* **String literals**: ‚úÖ Yes

‚úÖ These parts are fully under your control and can be in **any Unicode-supported language** like Hindi, Chinese, Arabic, etc.

```java
// ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§â‡§¶‡§æ‡§π‡§∞‡§£ ‡§π‡•à
String ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ = "‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡•ã‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ";
System.out.println("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á ‡§¶‡•Å‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ");
```

### ‚ùå 2. **What **cannot** be translated?**

* **Language Keywords** like:

  * `if`, `else`, `while`, `switch`, `for`, `class`, `public`, `return`, etc.

üß† These are **part of the programming language specification**, and they are **fixed** ‚Äî like grammar rules.

---

## ‚ùì Why are keywords not available in Hindi or other languages?

1. ‚úÖ Programming languages were originally designed **in English-speaking countries**.
2. ‚úÖ To ensure **global standardization**, the keywords were defined **in English**.
3. ‚ùå Most languages do **not support custom language localization** of keywords.

For example:

```java
// ‚ùå You CANNOT write this in Java
‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞ (x > 0) {
    ‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç x;
} ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ {
    ‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç 0;
}
```

This will give a **syntax error**, because Java doesn‚Äôt recognize `‡§Ö‡§ó‡§∞` (`if`), `‡§µ‡§æ‡§™‡§ø‡§∏ ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§Ç` (`return`), or `‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ` (`else`).

---

## üî∏ Are there any programming languages that support **native language keywords**?

### ‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî but they're rare or experimental.

Some examples:

| Language                        | Features                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LOLCODE**                     | Uses humorous English phrases like `HAI`, `KTHXBYE`     |
| **Bharat Programming Language** | A new project trying to bring Hindi-style keywords      |
| **Scratch (block-based)**       | Allows interface translation into Hindi or any language |
| **Catrobat / Blockly**          | Block languages with keyword localization support       |

But **mainstream languages like Java, C++, Python, etc. do not support keyword localization**.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature            | Can be Hindi/Any Language? | Example                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Variable Names     | ‚úÖ Yes                      | `int ‡§â‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞ = 25;`       |
| Function Names     | ‚úÖ Yes                      | `void ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§ì()`         |
| Comments           | ‚úÖ Yes                      | `// ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§è‡§ï ‡§ü‡§ø‡§™‡•ç‡§™‡§£‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à`  |
| String Literals    | ‚úÖ Yes                      | `"‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á"`             |
| Keywords (if, for) | ‚ùå No                       | Must remain in English |

---

## üß† TL;DR:

You **usually don‚Äôt manually specify** ASCII or Unicode in your source code, but the **editor/compiler/file encoding setting** tells the system how to interpret the characters.

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step.

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **How does the computer know which encoding is used in a program?**

### üîπ The **text editor or IDE** you use (like VS Code, IntelliJ, Notepad++, etc.) **saves the file using a certain encoding** ‚Äî most commonly **UTF-8**.

* You can check/set this in your editor.
* For example, in VS Code you‚Äôll see something like:

  ```
  UTF-8  üîΩ  (in the bottom-right corner)
  ```

### üîπ When you compile or run your program, the compiler or runtime:

* Reads the file as per the encoding.
* If encoding doesn't match actual file content: ‚ùå You get strange characters or errors.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **What is the default encoding?**

| Context             | Default Encoding                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Most modern editors | **UTF-8**                                                           |
| Java source files   | UTF-8 (since Java 18 officially)                                    |
| HTML/Web            | UTF-8 is the standard                                               |
| Linux terminals     | UTF-8                                                               |
| Windows             | Often used to be Windows-1252, but now also UTF-8 in newer versions |

---

## üî∏ 3. **Where can you specify the encoding (if needed)?**

### üíª In Java:

```bash
javac -encoding UTF-8 Hello.java
```

This tells the compiler to interpret the source file using UTF-8.

### üìÑ In HTML:

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

Tells the browser to interpret the HTML file as UTF-8 encoded.

---

## üîπ 4. **ASCII vs Unicode in real-world files**

* If your program only contains English characters, it looks **identical in ASCII and UTF-8**.
* But if you write `‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á` or `üòä`, **ASCII can‚Äôt store that** ‚Äî only Unicode (UTF-8/UTF-16/etc.) can.

---

## ‚ùó Important:

> Text encoding is **not part of the programming language syntax** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a property of **how the file is saved on disk**.

| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| How does computer know?                   | Based on how the file is saved (file encoding).                             |
| Where can I check?                        | In your code editor or by using compile/run options.                        |
