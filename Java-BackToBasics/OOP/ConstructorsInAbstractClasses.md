While it's true that you cannot directly create an object of an **abstract class** in Java, **abstract classes still have constructors** for the following reasons:

### 1. **Abstract Classes Can Have Fields (Instance Variables)**:
Abstract classes can have fields (instance variables), and these fields may need to be initialized when an object of a subclass is created. The constructor of the abstract class is used to initialize these fields.

### 2. **Abstract Class Constructors Are Called by Subclasses**:
Even though you can't create an instance of an abstract class directly, a subclass of the abstract class **can invoke the constructor of the abstract class**. This allows the abstract class to initialize its fields and perform other necessary setup before the subclass adds its own functionality.

### 3. **Purpose of Constructors in Abstract Classes**:
- The **constructor** in an abstract class is mainly used for setting up state (e.g., initializing variables) that will be inherited by subclasses.
- It ensures that when a subclass object is created, the parent (abstract) class is correctly initialized first.

### Example:

```java
abstract class Animal {
    String name;

    // Constructor of the abstract class
    Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        System.out.println("Animal constructor called.");
    }

    abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);  // Calls the constructor of the abstract class (Animal)
        System.out.println("Dog constructor called.");
    }

    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog("Buddy");
        // Outputs:
        // Animal constructor called.
        // Dog constructor called.
    }
}
```

### Breakdown:
- **Abstract Class Constructor**: `Animal(String name)` initializes the `name` field in the abstract class.
- **Subclass Constructor**: The `Dog` constructor calls the `super(name)` to invoke the constructor of the abstract class `Animal`, ensuring that the `name` field is set correctly.
- When the `Dog` object is created, the constructor of `Animal` is called first (due to `super(name)`), and then the constructor of `Dog` is executed.

### Why This Is Useful:
- **Initialization of Common State**: If multiple subclasses share common functionality (like a common field `name`), the abstract class constructor allows you to set this up without duplicating code in each subclass.
- **Inheritance of Behavior**: The constructor ensures that the inherited fields of the abstract class are properly initialized when creating an object of the subclass.

### Conclusion:
While you cannot instantiate an abstract class directly, abstract class constructors play an important role in initializing inherited fields and ensuring proper setup when objects of concrete subclasses are created.
