**Fork/Join** is a framework in Java designed to **take advantage of multiple CPU cores** by **splitting big tasks into smaller subtasks**, running them in **parallel**, and then **combining the results**. This is part of **Java’s concurrency utilities** and was introduced in **Java 7** under the `java.util.concurrent` package.

### 💡 Think of it like this:
Imagine you're sorting a huge pile of papers. You split it into 4 smaller piles and give each to a friend. Once everyone finishes sorting their pile, you collect and merge them. That’s *Fork/Join* in action.

### 📦 Main Classes in Fork/Join Framework

| Class | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ForkJoinPool` | A specialized thread pool for running `ForkJoinTask`s |
| `ForkJoinTask<V>` | Abstract base class for tasks |
| `RecursiveTask<V>` | A task that returns a result |
| `RecursiveAction` | A task that doesn’t return a result |

---

### 🛠 How It Works:

1. **Fork**: Break a task into smaller subtasks.
2. **Execute**: Subtasks are run in parallel using worker threads.
3. **Join**: Combine the results of the subtasks.

### 🧩 Simple Example: Recursive Sum with `RecursiveTask`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    int[] arr;
    int start, end;

    public SumTask(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 3) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                sum += arr[i];
            }
            return sum;
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            SumTask left = new SumTask(arr, start, mid);
            SumTask right = new SumTask(arr, mid, end);

            left.fork(); // Asynchronously execute left
            int rightResult = right.compute(); // Synchronously compute right
            int leftResult = left.join(); // Wait for left to complete

            return leftResult + rightResult;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) numbers[i] = i + 1;

        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        SumTask task = new SumTask(numbers, 0, numbers.length);

        int result = pool.invoke(task);
        System.out.println("Sum = " + result);
    }
}
```

### ✅ Key Advantages:

- **Efficient CPU usage**: Especially on multi-core processors.
- **Work-stealing**: Idle threads "steal" work from busy threads to balance the load.
- **Optimized for divide-and-conquer**: Great for recursive parallel algorithms.

### 🆚 Fork/Join vs ThreadPoolExecutor

| Feature | Fork/Join | ThreadPoolExecutor |
|--------|-----------|--------------------|
| Use Case | Divide-and-conquer, recursive tasks | General purpose parallelism |
| Work Stealing | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Task Granularity | Fine-grained | Usually coarser |
| Main Task Type | `ForkJoinTask` | `Runnable`/`Callable` |
