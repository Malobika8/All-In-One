Let’s dive into what makes **ReentrantLock** special and different from just using `synchronized`! 🌟

---

## 🔍 **1. Reentrancy (The “Reentrant” Part)**

The key feature that makes `ReentrantLock` special is **reentrancy**.

- Reentrancy means that the same thread can acquire the lock **multiple times** without blocking itself.
- Each `lock()` call increases a counter, and each `unlock()` call decreases it. The lock is only released when the counter reaches **zero**.

Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ReentrantExample {
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void outerMethod() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("Outer method acquired the lock.");
            innerMethod();  // Can call another method that needs the same lock
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void innerMethod() {
        lock.lock();  // Same thread can acquire the lock again!
        try {
            System.out.println("Inner method acquired the lock.");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantExample example = new ReentrantExample();
        example.outerMethod();
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Outer method acquired the lock.
Inner method acquired the lock.
```

Why is this special?  
- If `ReentrantLock` wasn’t reentrant, the thread would get **stuck forever** when trying to acquire the lock a second time in `innerMethod()`. 🚨

---

## ⚙️ **2. Advanced Lock Control**

Unlike `synchronized`, `ReentrantLock` gives you more control over how you acquire the lock:

1. **Try-Lock (Non-blocking):**  
   - Lets you check if the lock is available instead of waiting forever.

```java
if (lock.tryLock()) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock acquired!");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Lock not available.");
}
```

2. **Try-Lock with Timeout:**  
   - Allows you to **wait for a certain amount of time** for the lock.

```java
if (lock.tryLock(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock acquired within timeout!");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Could not acquire lock after 1 second.");
}
```

3. **Interruptible Locking:**  
   - Allows threads to be interrupted while waiting for the lock. This is impossible with `synchronized`!

```java
try {
    lock.lockInterruptibly();
    try {
        System.out.println("Lock acquired, and I can be interrupted!");
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    System.out.println("Thread was interrupted while waiting for the lock.");
}
```

Let’s create an example to demonstrate **`lockInterruptibly()`** in action. 🚀

### 🌟 **What does `lockInterruptibly()` do?**

- `lockInterruptibly()` allows a thread to **respond to interrupts** while waiting for the lock.
- If another thread interrupts the waiting thread, it **exits immediately** with an `InterruptedException`.

Without `lockInterruptibly()`, a thread waiting for `lock()` will **block indefinitely** until the lock is released, ignoring interruptions.

---

### ⚙️ **Example: Simulating Interruptible Locking**

In this example:
- `Worker` threads try to perform a task by acquiring a lock.
- One thread is **interrupted** while waiting for the lock, causing it to stop gracefully.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class InterruptibleLockExample {

    private static final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    static class Worker implements Runnable {
        private final String name;

        Worker(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                System.out.println(name + " is trying to acquire the lock...");
                lock.lockInterruptibly();  // Allows interruption while waiting for the lock
                try {
                    System.out.println(name + " acquired the lock. Working...");
                    Thread.sleep(5000);  // Simulate long-running task
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                    System.out.println(name + " released the lock.");
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(name + " was interrupted while waiting for the lock.");
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Worker("Thread-1"));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Worker("Thread-2"));

        t1.start();
        Thread.sleep(100);  // Let t1 acquire the lock first
        t2.start();

        // Interrupt t2 after 1 second (it will be waiting for the lock)
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        t2.interrupt();
    }
}
```

---

### 📝 **Explanation:**

1. `Thread-1` acquires the lock and holds it for **5 seconds**.
2. `Thread-2` tries to acquire the lock but gets **stuck waiting**.
3. After **1 second**, `Thread-2` is interrupted while waiting.
4. Since `Thread-2` used `lockInterruptibly()`, it **exits immediately** when interrupted, printing a message.

---

### 📌 **Expected Output:**

```
Thread-1 is trying to acquire the lock...
Thread-1 acquired the lock. Working...
Thread-2 is trying to acquire the lock...
Thread-2 was interrupted while waiting for the lock.
Thread-1 released the lock.
```

---

### 🌟 **Why is this special?**

If you used `lock()` instead of `lockInterruptibly()`, `Thread-2` would keep waiting, ignoring the interruption!

---

## ⚖️ **3. Fairness (First Come, First Served)**

`ReentrantLock` lets you create a **fair lock**, ensuring that the thread that has been waiting the longest gets the lock first.

```java
ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Fair lock
```

In contrast, `synchronized` and the default `ReentrantLock` are **non-fair**, meaning any thread can grab the lock, even if other threads have been waiting longer. Non-fair locks are faster due to less overhead.

---

## 📊 **4. Lock State Monitoring**

With `ReentrantLock`, you can check the lock's state at runtime. `synchronized` doesn’t let you do this!

- `isLocked()` — Checks if the lock is held by any thread.
- `isHeldByCurrentThread()` — Checks if the current thread holds the lock.
- `getHoldCount()` — Returns how many times the current thread acquired the lock.

```java
System.out.println("Is locked? " + lock.isLocked());
System.out.println("Held by current thread? " + lock.isHeldByCurrentThread());
System.out.println("Hold count: " + lock.getHoldCount());
```

## 🎓 **When to Use `ReentrantLock`?**

✅ Use `ReentrantLock` when:
- You need **more control** over the lock.
- You want to **avoid blocking** with `tryLock()` or use **timeouts**.
- You want to handle **interruptible locking**.
- You’re building a system that needs **fairness** (e.g., first-come, first-served access).

❌ Use `synchronized` when:
- You just need **simple locking** without extra control.
- Performance is a concern, and the lock isn’t heavily contended.

---

## 🏁 **Key Takeaways**

- **ReentrantLock** is more powerful and flexible than `synchronized`.
- It supports **try-locking**, **timeouts**, **interruptibility**, and **fairness**.
- You need to **manually lock and unlock**, so forgetting `unlock()` leads to **deadlocks**.
