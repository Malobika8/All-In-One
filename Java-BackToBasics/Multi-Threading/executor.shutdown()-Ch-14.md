### 🧩 The Code:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

executor.submit(() -> {
    System.out.println("Task 1");
});

executor.submit(() -> {
    try {
        Thread.sleep(3000);
        System.out.println("Task 2 (after delay)");
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        System.out.println("Task 2 interrupted");
    }
});

executor.shutdown();  // 👈 this line
```

---

### 🧠 What’s happening under the hood?

1. `executor.submit(...)` queues up your tasks.
2. `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3)` creates **3 idle threads** waiting to run tasks.
3. When you call `submit()`, the task goes into a **work queue**.
4. The thread pool picks up queued tasks and runs them as soon as possible using the available threads.
5. Now, your `executor.shutdown()` is being run **by the main thread**, not the thread pool itself.

---

### 🔍 So... can `shutdown()` run before the tasks?

Yes. But here’s the catch:

- `shutdown()` **does not cancel or remove any already-submitted tasks**.
- It **only prevents** new tasks from being submitted **after it is called**.
- Even if you called `shutdown()` *before* any worker picked up `Task 1` or `Task 2`, they will **still be picked up and executed**.

---

### ✅ Let’s visualize it:

| Time | Action                                  | What happens?                         |
|------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| t=0  | Fixed thread pool created (3 threads)    | 3 threads idle, waiting for tasks      |
| t=1  | `submit(Task 1)`                         | Goes to the task queue                 |
| t=2  | `submit(Task 2)`                         | Also goes to the task queue            |
| t=3  | `shutdown()`                             | No new tasks will be accepted          |
| t=4  | Threads pick up Task 1 and Task 2        | Runs just fine                         |

Even if the threads had not picked the tasks before `shutdown()` — they **still will**, as long as those tasks were **submitted before shutdown**.

---

### ❌ What doesn't happen:

- `shutdown()` doesn't kill threads.
- `shutdown()` doesn't cancel or skip submitted tasks.
- So `Task 1` and `Task 2` will always execute **unless you use `shutdownNow()`**.

---

### 🧪 If you want to see it clearly:

You can **intentionally delay task pickup** to simulate the race condition:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " picked a task");
};

executor.submit(task);
executor.submit(task);

// Simulate delay between submission and shutdown
Thread.sleep(100);  // Optional, just for experiment

executor.shutdown();
```

Even with the delay, the tasks will run.

---

### ✅ TL;DR

> Even if `shutdown()` is called **before tasks are picked up**, those already submitted tasks will **still execute**. `shutdown()` just prevents **new submissions** after it's called — it doesn’t interfere with existing ones.

---

### ✅ What happens when you call `submit()`?

When you do this:

```java
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 1"));
```

👉 You are **submitting the task to the ExecutorService**.  
That means:

- The task is **added to the internal task queue** (`BlockingQueue<Runnable>`).
- The ExecutorService marks it as "ready to be picked up".
- You also get back a `Future<?>`, which is a reference to track the result (if you want).

Even if **none of the threads have picked it up yet**, the task is still **owned** by the executor.

---

### 🧠 Now what does `shutdown()` do?

When you call:

```java
executor.shutdown();
```

🔒 This does two things:

1. Marks the executor as **“shutting down”** — meaning:
   - No new tasks are accepted.  
   - Any call to `submit()` **after** this will throw `RejectedExecutionException`.

2. Leaves the task queue and running threads **untouched**:
   - Existing tasks in the queue ✅ stay.
   - Running tasks ✅ continue.
   - Threads keep working until all tasks are done.

---

✅ Once submitted, they belong to the executor's queue — and the executor is committed to finishing what it already accepted.

### 📊 Visual Timeline

```
Main thread:        submit(Task 1) ──────────> [Task Queue]  
Main thread:        submit(Task 2) ──────────> [Task Queue]  
Main thread:        shutdown()    ───────────> [Stops new tasks ❌]  
Worker threads:     pick Task 1 and Task 2 ✅  
```

---

### 🔄 What happens if you do this instead?

```java
executor.shutdown();
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task 3"));
```

This will crash with:

```
java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException
```

Because `shutdown()` was already called.
