- Open source: This can be easily downloaded and installed from Apache portal. Bugs need to be managed by own or maybe required to upgrade.
- Commercial: It comes with a lot of tools and utility to perform day-to-day operation. Confluent Kafka is one of the best commercial distribution to use. It simplifies connecting datasource
  to the Kafka, building streaming applications, securing, monitoring & managing Kafka.
- Managed: This comes with everything we need. We just need to create an instance as per required configuration & everything else is managed by the Kafka provider. It's really easy to scale
  when needed similar to could infra.
