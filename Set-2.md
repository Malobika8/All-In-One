Here's a **combined set of frequently asked coding and Java 8-based questions** specifically tailored for someone with **3 years of experience**, often seen in **coding rounds** or **technical interviews**.

## ✅ Part 1: Java 8 + Streams + Lambda-Based Coding Questions

These are very common and often appear in real interviews.

| #  | Question                                                                   |
| -- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | Find the first non-repeating character in a string using Java 8 Streams.   |
| 2  | Given a list of integers, return a list of squares of even numbers.        |
| 3  | Count the frequency of each character in a string using Java 8.            |
| 4  | Sort a list of `Employee` objects by salary, then by name using streams.   |
| 5  | Find the highest-paid employee in each department.                         |
| 6  | Group a list of strings by their length.                                   |
| 7  | Remove duplicate elements from a list using streams.                       |
| 8  | Convert a list of strings into a single comma-separated string.            |
| 9  | Given a list of numbers, check if all numbers are even using Java 8.       |
| 10 | Convert a `List<String>` of numbers into `List<Integer>` and find the max. |

## ✅ Part 2: Logic + Data Structure-Based Coding Questions

No need for LeetCode-level hard questions, but **medium-level problems with logic clarity** is a must.

| #  | Question                                                           |
| -- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1  | Find the **kth smallest/largest** element in an array.             |
| 2  | Reverse only the vowels in a string.                               |
| 3  | Check if two strings are anagrams.                                 |
| 4  | Find the missing number in an array of size n-1 with range 1 to n. |
| 5  | Find duplicates in an array (return list or set).                  |
| 6  | Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array.                     |
| 7  | Find the longest substring without repeating characters.           |
| 8  | Find all pairs in an array that sum up to a target value.          |
| 9  | Move all zeros to the end of an array while maintaining the order. |
| 10 | Implement a basic LRU Cache (even explaining logic is good).       |

## ✅ Part 3: Bonus — Frequently Asked Mini Design Questions

They don’t expect full system design, but these are **light design-oriented questions**:

| # | Question                                                             |
| - | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Design a simple URL shortener (basic flow, storage, endpoint idea).  |
| 2 | Design an in-memory cache for product search (mention Map/DB ideas). |
| 3 | Create REST APIs to manage books in a library (CRUD APIs).           |
| 4 | Explain how you would design a login system with token-based auth.   |
