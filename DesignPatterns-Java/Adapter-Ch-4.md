## Adapter - Structural design pattern

Adapter is something which converts one form to another. It is involved with how the classes interact with each other.

A lot of times, we cannot build software systems without using third party libraries/api's. And a lot of times, we might have to change the 
third party api's. Or certain times, we might want to add another api, that does the same, as an alternative.

This change of API should not take huge amount of time. This addition should be flexible and easy to do.

Adapter helps with the same.
