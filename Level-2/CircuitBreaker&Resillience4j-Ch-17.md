The **Circuit Breaker Pattern** is one of the most **essential patterns for building resilient microservices**.

## üß† Why Do We Need a Circuit Breaker?

Suppose your service (A) calls another service (B) which is **down** or **very slow**.

Without a circuit breaker:

* Every request to B keeps failing or timing out.
* Threads get stuck, resources exhausted.
* **Cascading failure**: Service A becomes slow or crashes too.

üß® **Problem**: Your app wastes time and threads calling something that‚Äôs already broken.

## ‚úÖ What Is the Circuit Breaker Pattern?

A **Circuit Breaker** acts like a **firewall** between your app and the failing service.

It has **3 states**:

```
         ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
         ‚îÇ   Closed   ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Service is healthy ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Calls go through
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚îÇ Failures exceed threshold
              ‚ñº
         ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
         ‚îÇ   Open     ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Service is failing ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∂ Calls are blocked immediately
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
              ‚îÇ Wait timeout expires
              ‚ñº
         ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
         ‚îÇ Half-Open  ‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Trial calls are allowed to test recovery
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### üîÅ Lifecycle in Simple Terms:

| State         | What Happens                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Closed**    | All calls are allowed. If too many fail, go to **Open**.                 |
| **Open**      | No calls go through. After `X` seconds, go to **Half-Open**.             |
| **Half-Open** | Try one or two calls. If success ‚Üí go **Closed**, else ‚Üí **Open** again. |

---

## üéØ Real-World Analogy

> Imagine calling a friend whose phone is always switched off.

* You try 5 times ‚Äî still switched off (failures).
* You stop calling for 1 minute (**Open state**).
* Then try again after a while (**Half-Open**).
* If it connects, you start calling normally again (**Closed**).

## üíª Implementing Circuit Breaker in Spring Boot using Resilience4j

Add to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot3</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Annotate your method

```java
@CircuitBreaker(name = "paymentService", fallbackMethod = "fallbackPayment")
public String callPaymentService() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://external-payment-api/pay", String.class);
}
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Fallback method

```java
public String fallbackPayment(Throwable t) {
    return "Payment service is currently unavailable. Please try later.";
}
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure the Circuit Breaker (Optional)

In `application.yml`:

```yaml
resilience4j:
  circuitbreaker:
    instances:
      paymentService:
        failure-rate-threshold: 50
        minimum-number-of-calls: 10
        wait-duration-in-open-state: 10s
        sliding-window-size: 20
```

**Explanation:**

* If **50% of 10 calls fail**, circuit opens.
* Wait 10s before trying again.
* Use a window of 20 calls to track failures.

## üîÑ Summary

| Term      | Meaning                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Closed    | Normal state ‚Äî calls allowed                       |
| Open      | Failing state ‚Äî calls blocked to protect resources |
| Half-Open | Trial state ‚Äî allows a few calls to test recovery  |
| Fallback  | Optional method to return a default response       |

---

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* Protects your app from cascading failures
* Improves performance during downstream outages
* Provides graceful fallback options
