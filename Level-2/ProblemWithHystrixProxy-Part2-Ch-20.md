# “If we use `@HystrixCommand` (or `@CircuitBreaker`) on a method inside a class, and call that method from **another method in the same class**, will it work?”

### ❌ Answer: **No, it won’t work.**

---

## 🤖 Why Doesn’t It Work?

Spring uses something called a **proxy** to make `@HystrixCommand`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Async`, `@Transactional`, etc., work.

Let’s break that down in super simple terms:

---

### 🔧 How Spring Makes Annotations Work

When you use annotations like:

```java
@HystrixCommand
@CircuitBreaker
@Async
@Transactional
```

Spring creates a **proxy object** around your class — like a "wrapper" — that adds extra behavior.

This proxy can:

* Monitor failures (`@HystrixCommand`)
* Run in another thread (`@Async`)
* Manage transactions (`@Transactional`)

---

## 💥 But Here’s the Catch

When you call one method from another **inside the same class**, you're bypassing the proxy.

So if you do this:

```java
@Service
public class CatalogService {

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String serviceA() {
        return "Hello";
    }

    public String serviceB() {
        return serviceA(); // 🔴 Direct internal call = proxy is bypassed!
    }

    public String fallback() {
        return "Fallback";
    }
}
```

➡️ `@HystrixCommand` on `serviceA()` will **NOT work** when called from `serviceB()`
➡️ Because **the call didn’t go through the Spring proxy**

---

## ✅ How to Make It Work Properly

### Option 1: Move the method to a **different service class**

This is what we did earlier with `MovieInfoService` and `RatingService`.

Spring injects the proxy when it's a different bean.

```java
@Component
public class MovieInfoService {
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public Movie getMovieInfo(...) { ... }
}
```

```java
@Service
public class CatalogService {
    @Autowired
    private MovieInfoService movieInfoService;

    public CatalogItem getCatalog(...) {
        return movieInfoService.getMovieInfo(...);  // ✅ goes through proxy
    }
}
```

---

### Option 2: Call the current bean’s proxy via `ApplicationContext`

This is a bit of a hack:

```java
@Autowired
private ApplicationContext context;

public String serviceB() {
    return context.getBean(this.getClass()).serviceA(); // ✅ works via proxy
}
```

But this is not clean or recommended — use **Option 1**.

## 🧠 Summary: Proxy Rule for Annotations

| Annotation        | Needs Proxy | Works with internal call? |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| `@HystrixCommand` | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                      |
| `@CircuitBreaker` | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                      |
| `@Async`          | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                      |
| `@Transactional`  | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No                      |

---

## ✅ Best Practice

> ✨ Always apply annotations like `@HystrixCommand`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Async` to **methods in separate service/bean classes**, and call them via Spring injection (not directly).
