# If two APIs are **independent**, but **one slow API causes the other to be slow too**, it **indicates some hidden coupling** or **shared resource bottleneck**.

#### üîç Possible Reasons Why One Slow API Affects Another "Independent" One

- **Thread Pool Exhaustion**

Both APIs might be handled by the **same servlet/container thread pool** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty).

* If API-1 is slow and consumes all threads,
* API-2 must **wait for a free thread**, even if it's fast.

## üõ† **Fix:**
Use dedicated thread pools, tune `server.tomcat.max-threads`, or offload heavy tasks to async executors. Timeouts.

## ‚úÖ How to Set Timeout on Spring `RestTemplate`

You can configure timeouts using `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory` or `SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory`.

### Example (Recommended: `HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory`)

```java
@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory factory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();
    factory.setConnectTimeout(3000);    // Time to establish the connection (ms)
    factory.setReadTimeout(5000);       // Time to wait for data (ms)
    
    return new RestTemplate(factory);
}
```

### Alternative (For basic use):

```java
SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory factory = new SimpleClientHttpRequestFactory();
factory.setConnectTimeout(3000);
factory.setReadTimeout(5000);
```

## What Timeout Solves

### It prevents your thread from **waiting forever** on:

* Slow external services
* Network issues
* Unresponsive downstream systems

‚û°Ô∏è So, instead of blocking indefinitely, your API will **fail fast** (e.g., after 3 seconds) and can fallback, retry, or handle the error gracefully.

---

### ‚ùå What Timeout **Does NOT Solve**

> "What if the rate of request is more than what the timeout is?"

### Let‚Äôs break it down:

Say your timeout is 3 seconds, but you're getting **100 requests/second**, and each one tries to call a slow external service.

* Each request takes 3 sec to timeout.
* Each one holds on to a **server thread** for 3 seconds.
* Result? üí• **Thread pool exhaustion**, leading to total system slowdown or crash.

So yes ‚Äî **timeout alone doesn't solve high load** or **backpressure**.

## ‚úÖ What Else You Need Along With Timeout

| Tool/Pattern         | What It Solves                                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Timeout            | Prevents waiting forever                                   |
| ‚úÖ Circuit Breaker    | Stops calling broken/downstream services                   |
| ‚úÖ Rate Limiter       | Prevents flooding external APIs                            |
| ‚úÖ Bulkhead Pattern   | Isolates failures (e.g., limits impact to one thread pool) |
| ‚úÖ Thread Pool Tuning | Avoids running out of server threads                       |
| ‚úÖ Queue + Async      | Offload work, apply backpressure                           |
| ‚úÖ Caching            | Avoid unnecessary external calls                           |

> **‚ÄúTimeout is a line of defense ‚Äî not the entire fortress.‚Äù**
> You must combine it with:

* `Retry`
* `CircuitBreaker`
* `RateLimiter`
* `Fallbacks`

Use tools like **Resilience4j**, **Bucket4j**, or **Spring Cloud CircuitBreaker**.
