## 🌟 What is a Proxy?

A **proxy** is like a **middleman** or **wrapper** that sits between your code and the real object.

Let’s say you have:

```java
public class MovieService {
    public String getMovie() {
        return "Batman Begins";
    }
}
```

Now Spring creates a **proxy object**:

```text
Your call ➡️ [Proxy] ➡️ Real MovieService
```

The proxy can **add extra behavior** like:

* Timeout
* Logging
* Fallback
* Transaction
* Async

---

## 💡 Real-Life Analogy

Let’s say you call customer care.

You: "I want to cancel my subscription"
➡️ A **customer care agent (proxy)** takes your call, does checks, and then cancels it on your behalf.

You **didn't directly talk to the billing department** — the proxy handled it.

---

## 🧠 Spring’s Role with Proxies

When you use annotations like `@HystrixCommand`, `@CircuitBreaker`, or `@Async`, **Spring creates a proxy object** for that class at runtime.

### Example:

```java
@Component
public class MovieInfoService {
    
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public Movie getMovie(String movieId) {
        // call slow MovieDB API
    }
}
```

✅ When you call `getMovie(...)` from **outside the class**, like:

```java
@Autowired
MovieInfoService service;

service.getMovie("123");
```

➡️ You’re calling the **proxy**, so Hystrix works.

---

## 💥 But What Happens If You Call It Inside the Same Class?

```java
public class MovieInfoService {

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public Movie getMovie(String id) {
        return restTemplate.getForObject(...);
    }

    public void someOtherMethod() {
        this.getMovie("123");  // ❌ This skips the proxy!
    }
}
```

Here, `this.getMovie()` is a **direct call** inside the class.

➡️ It **bypasses the proxy**, so Hystrix **does NOT apply the circuit breaker**.

---

## ✅ Why Spring Does This?

Because Spring's AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) works by **wrapping beans with proxies** at the time of injection.

🔧 So if your method is called:

* From another bean → ✅ proxy is involved → AOP works
* From within the same class → ❌ proxy is skipped → AOP does not work

---

## 🔍 Visual Summary

```
[CatalogService]
     |
     | calls via Spring
     ▼
[MovieInfoService Proxy] ← applies Hystrix
     |
     ▼
[Real MovieInfoService]
```

But:

```java
MovieInfoService.this.getMovie(); // ← skips proxy → no Hystrix
```

---

## 🧠 How to Always Make It Work

✅ Move such methods to a **separate service class** and call them via `@Autowired`.

```java
@Component
public class MovieInfoService {
    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public Movie getMovie(String id) { ... }
}

@Component
public class CatalogService {
    @Autowired MovieInfoService movieInfoService;

    public void buildCatalog() {
        movieInfoService.getMovie("123"); // ✅ goes through proxy!
    }
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Tip

> ❗ "Spring AOP (like Hystrix, Transactional, Async, etc.) only works if the call goes through the Spring Proxy."

This is **one of the most commonly misunderstood things** in Spring development.

# REVISE

## ✅ What Happens When You Call an `@Autowired` Service?

### Let’s say you do:

```java
@Autowired
MovieInfoService movieInfoService;

movieInfoService.getMovie("123");
```

### Here’s What Actually Happens:

```
Your Code → [Spring Proxy] → getMovie() → CircuitBreaker/Hystrix/Transaction logic applied → Real Method
```

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 🧩 1. Spring Injects a **Proxy Object**

```java
MovieInfoService movieInfoService = new ProxyThatWrapsRealMovieInfoService();
```

This proxy is generated at runtime by Spring (using CGLIB or JDK dynamic proxies).

---

### 🧠 2. You Call the Method → Proxy Intercepts It

```java
movieInfoService.getMovie("123");
```

➡️ Control goes to **proxy first**, not the actual method.

---

### 🛠️ 3. Proxy Applies Additional Logic (AOP)

Depending on annotations:

* `@HystrixCommand` → it wraps with circuit breaker
* `@Transactional` → it opens/closes transactions
* `@Async` → runs in a new thread
* `@Retry` → adds retry logic
* `@Cacheable` → checks cache first

> All of these are applied **before calling the actual method**.

---

### 📞 4. Proxy Then Calls the Real Service Method

```java
return realMovieInfoService.getMovie("123");
```

So the **actual method runs**, but now it’s surrounded by Hystrix logic, or wrapped in a transaction, etc.

---

## ❌ Why Internal Calls Bypass This

```java
this.getMovie("123"); // ❌ no proxy here, just a direct method call
```

When you call `this.method()` from inside the same class:

* It doesn't go through the proxy.
* So none of the annotations work.

---

## ✅ Summary

> **"When I use `@Autowired` to inject a service, I'm actually getting a Spring-managed proxy. This proxy intercepts my method call, applies logic like `@HystrixCommand` or `@Transactional`, and then delegates to the real method."**
