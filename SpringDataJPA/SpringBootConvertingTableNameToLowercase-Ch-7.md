The `@Table(name = "Person")` annotation should be specifying the table name as `"Person"`. If Hibernate is still creating the table as `"person"` instead, it might be due to the default Hibernate naming strategy, which converts table names to lowercase by default.

Here's a checklist to ensure the table name is exactly `"Person"`:

### **1. Ensure a Custom Naming Strategy**
As mentioned earlier, Hibernate’s default behavior is to convert table names to lowercase. To prevent this and respect the table name exactly as specified, you need to set a **custom physical naming strategy**.

You can do this by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

#### **In `application.properties`**
```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy=org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

#### **In `application.yml`**
```yaml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      naming:
        physical-strategy: org.hibernate.boot.model.naming.PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl
```

This will tell Hibernate to respect the name you specify in the `@Table` annotation, i.e., `"Person"`, instead of converting it to lowercase.

---

### **2. Clean Database**
If you’ve previously run your application with the default strategy, Hibernate may have already created the `"person"` table. You can:
- Drop the existing table manually, or
- Set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create` in `application.properties` to recreate the schema, or
- Change `ddl-auto` to `update` to allow Hibernate to attempt updating the schema.

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

This will ensure that Hibernate recreates the schema and follows your naming strategy.

### **3. Verify Database Table**
Once you’ve applied these changes, you can verify that the table is created with the correct name in your database. The table should now be named `"Person"`, respecting the casing from the `@Table(name = "Person")` annotation.

---

### **4. Other Possible Configuration Conflicts**
Make sure that there are no conflicting configurations in your application that could override these settings, such as:
- Custom `@EntityScan` or repository configurations
- Other naming strategy settings applied elsewhere in the project

---

### **Conclusion**
- Set the `spring.jpa.hibernate.naming.physical-strategy` property to `PhysicalNamingStrategyStandardImpl` to prevent automatic lowercase conversion.
- Make sure the database schema is in sync with the entity configuration (clean database or `ddl-auto` settings).
- If the issue persists, try logging the generated SQL queries to verify the table name.
