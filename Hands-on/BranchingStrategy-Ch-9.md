# ðŸŒ¿ Git Branching Strategies

These are structured ways to manage features, bug fixes, releases, and production stability using Git branches.

---

## âœ… Why Use Branching Strategies?

Without a strategy:

* Teams step on each otherâ€™s work
* Production may break
* Release cycles become chaotic

With a strategy:

* Clear roles for each branch
* Safe parallel development
* Easier testing, hotfixing, and releasing

## ðŸš€ Common Branching Strategies

### 1. **Git Flow** (classic, full-featured)

```
main
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ develop
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/login
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ feature/payment
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ release/v1.0
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ hotfix/fix-crash
```

**Branches:**

| Branch      | Purpose                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready, stable code   |
| `develop`   | Integration branch for features |
| `feature/*` | New features                    |
| `release/*` | Pre-release testing             |
| `hotfix/*`  | Urgent fixes for production     |

ðŸ“Œ Good for large teams, strict processes

### 2. **GitHub Flow** (simple, modern)

```
main
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/add-comments
```

**Workflow:**

* Everything is merged into `main` via **pull requests**
* `main` is always deployable
* Feature branches â†’ PR â†’ reviewed â†’ merged â†’ deploy

ðŸ“Œ Ideal for continuous deployment teams

---

### 3. **GitLab Flow** (hybrid of Git Flow + CI/CD)

* Supports **environments** (e.g., staging, production)
* Works with **issue tracking**
* Flexible: lets you combine tags, environments, release branches

ðŸ“Œ Great for DevOps + CI/CD-driven teams

---

### 4. **Trunk-Based Development** (fast-moving teams)

* Everyone works off a single shared branch (often `main`)
* Small, frequent commits
* Feature toggles used to hide incomplete features

ðŸ“Œ Advanced teams, heavy CI/CD, minimal branching

## ðŸ§ª Which to Choose?

| Team Size        | Strategy                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Solo/Small team  | GitHub Flow                |
| Mid-sized team   | Git Flow                   |
| Large enterprise | Git Flow or GitLab Flow    |
| DevOps, CI/CD    | Trunk-Based or GitLab Flow |
