## FYI

Swagger UI and OpenAPI are related but distinct concepts. OpenAPI is a specification language used to describe RESTful APIs, providing a 
standardized way to define API endpoints, models, and interactions. Swagger UI, on the other hand, is a user interface that uses OpenAPI 
specifications to generate interactive API documentation, allowing developers to explore and test APIs. While OpenAPI provides the structure 
and content, Swagger UI provides the presentation layer, making it a popular choice for documenting and showcasing APIs.

The OpenAPI specification is based on the Swagger specification (Swagger 2.0), but it has evolved and expanded to become a broader and more 
standardized specification for describing APIs.

Swagger is the predecessor to OpenAPI and refers specifically to version 2.0 of the specification.

OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 are the newer versions of Swagger 2.0. They share the same purpose and support the same use cases, such as API design, 
API governance, API documentation, server and client code generation, and API gateway configuration.
