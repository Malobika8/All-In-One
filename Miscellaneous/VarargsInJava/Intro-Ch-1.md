## Need of Variable length arguments

Consider a scenario where we want to add two numbers.

We can have a method that takes two arguments and return the sum. Similarly to add 3 or more numbers, we can do method overloading.

However, this approach isn't good as it leads to Code Redundancy.

#### Hwo to solve this then?

In Java 1.5, variable length argument was introduced. Whenever we are not sure about the number of arguments in a method, we can make use of
variable arguments (aka varargs).
