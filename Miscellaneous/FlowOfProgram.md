# Flowcharts

Flowcharts are used to visualize thought process and whatever algorithm we may create.

It is basically graphical representation of a workflow or process, which shows the steps and decisions involved in completing a task. 
It is used to visualize, analyze, and improve business processes by representing them in a logical and sequential manner. Flowcharts can 
help to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement in a process. They are commonly used in project management, 
business analysis, and software development. There are several types of flowcharts, including process flowcharts, decision flowcharts, and 
data flowcharts.

# Pseudocode

 Pseudocode is a code-like representation of a sequence of steps or algorithm in a computer programming or problem-solving process. It is a
 high-level, simplified version of code that is used to communicate the logic of a program to human readers, or to help programmers 
 visualize and understand the flow of a program. Pseudocode is not executable by itself, but is typically transformed into a real 
 programming language before being executed by a computer.
